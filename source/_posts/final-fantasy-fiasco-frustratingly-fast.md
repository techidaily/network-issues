2. **[Use a wired connection](#fix2)**
3. **[Disconnect other devices](#fix3)**

![how to fix Epic Games download slow](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/egs-twitchchannel-generic-offline-1920x1080-9d2573f00465.png)

## 1\. Check the server status

 To narrow down the source of the problem, the first thing you need to do is to check the [Epic Games status page](https://status.epicgames.com/) .

 If there are known server issues going on, they are usually visible on the page. If the problem is not from the server’s end, try the fixes below.

---

## 2\. Use a wired connection

 To download large files efficiently, a wired connection is preferable over a wireless connection to the internet. Wireless connections are most susceptible to interference and aren’t as consistent as wired connections. Therefore, if possible, use a wired connection.

 However, if you are not able to opt for a wired connection, check out the next fix below.

---

## 3\. Disconnect other devices

 The download issue is sometimes caused by your router struggling with the number of connections due to too many downloads happening simultaneously. To work around this, you need to first restart your router. Simply unplug your router or modem from its power outlet. Wait for 15-20 seconds, then plug it back in.

 If you have other devices connected to your Wi-Fi, disconnect them while you’re downloading games.

 When it’s all done, resume your download and check if it helps you fix the issue. If you’re still experiencing slow download speed or the download is stuck at a certain percent, proceed to the next fix.

---

## 4\. Update your network adapter driver

 If the previous steps didn’t work, it’s time to check if you’re using an outdated network adapter driver. An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. To fix it, you should update your drivers and your problem may be solved in no time.

##### How you can update your network adapter driver

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it.

## 5\. Switch Domain Name Systems (DNS)

 Sometimes your ISP-supplied DNS server might be slow or not properly configured for caching, which can effectively slow your connection. Switching your DNS can result in better connectivity and performance for your internet connection and save you time troubleshooting.

Here we recommend using Google DNS:

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd** . Then click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-cmd-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click **Yes**  to continue.
3. In the command prompt window, type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-2.jpg)
4. Type **ipconfig /renew** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-3.jpg)
5. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/win-11-run-control-panel.jpg)
6. View by **Category** , and select **Network and Internet** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/network-and-internet.png) .
7. Select **Network and Sharing Center** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/network-and-sharing-center.png)
8. Click the Internet connection you’re using, then select **Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-44.png)
9. Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP /IPv4)** **\> Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-DNS-server-Internet-Protocol-Version.jpg)
10. Click **Use the following DNS server addresses:**  

 For **Preferred DNS server** , type **8.8.8.8**  
 For **Alternate DNS server** , type **8.8.4.4**  

 Check the box next to **Validate settings upon exit**  and then click **OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-DNS-server-8888-8844-1.jpg)

 Now resume your download and check if your problem is solved. If not, try the next fix below.

## 6\. Edit your Engine.ini file

 Players report editing some settings in the Engine.ini file can result in better download speeds. So you can give it a shot.

Here’s how to do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key + R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type**%localappdata%** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/localappdata.png)
2. Open folders**EpicGamesLauncher > Saved > Config > Windows** .
3. Find**Engine.ini** . Right-click it and select**Edit with Notepad++** or whatever notepad app you’re using.  
![Epic Games Launcher edit Engine.ini file](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/edit-with-notepad.png)
4. Copy and paste the following lines:

**[HTTP]**
**HttpTimeout=10**
**HttpConnectionTimeout=10**
**HttpReceiveTimeout=10**
**HttpSendTimeout=10**

**[Portal.BuildPatch]**
**ChunkDownloads=3**
**ChunkRetries=20**
**RetryTime=0.5**

![Epic Games Launcher edit Engine.ini file](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/edit-ini-file.png)

 6) Press**Ctrl + S** to save the edits.

When it’s all done, resume your download and it should be faster.

## 7\. Set the throttle speed to Unlimited

 Setting the default throttle speed in Epic Games Launcher also helps to pick up the download speed. To do so:

1. Launch the Epic Games Launcher.
2. Click the profile icon on the top right corner and then Settings.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-52.png)
3. Scroll down a bit to tick the box for Throttle Downloads. Then set the download speed to 0.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-53.png)
