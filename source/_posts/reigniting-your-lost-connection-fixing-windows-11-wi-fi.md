## Fix 4: Reset the Winsock settings

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key**   and **R**   at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd**   and press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Enter**   at the same time to **run**  **Command Prompt**  **as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission.

3. **Restart**  your PC to complete the reset.

See if your wireless network adapter appears in Device Managers.

## Fix 5: Replace your network interface controller card

 If your wireless network adapter doesn’t appear in Device Manager after you tried all the fixes above, it’s time to consult the manufacturer of your PC for further support, since the worst case of this issue could be the problem of your**NIC (network interface controller) card** .
