### Method 1: Update your graphics driver

 Drivers handle the communication between your computer hardware and your operating system, programs, and apps. Therefore, if your graphic driver is outdated or corrupt, your program may not be able to initialize your graphics system.

 Since graphics drivers need regular updates to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance for new PC games, you should always update your graphics driver to ensure a better game experience. Above all, it can prevent you from bumping into various crashing issues in the future.

* Option 1 —[**Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* Option 2 —[**Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/quick-fix-unable-to-initialize-graphics-system-error/#option2)

####  Option 1— Update with Device Manager

 To update your graphics card driver manually, you’ll first need to check the Device Manager for any updates. However, Windows won’t always find the latest driver for you. If Windows fails to find a newer one, you’ll need to find the exact graphics driver online ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)) and install it manually.

 If you don’t know the exact graphics driver you’re using, go to**Device Manager** \> right click your graphics driver >**Properties** \>**Driver** to get more driver details such as driver provider and driver version, etc. 

####  Option 2—Update All Your Drivers With Simple Clicks

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  —This is the quickest and easiest option.
