### Fix 1: Change the monitor refresh rate

 A refresh rate is the number of times in a second that images are refreshed. Generally a higher refresh rate produces a smoother picture and less screen flickering or flashing issue. So we might have to change the monitor refresh rate to find the most suited one for your PC monitor.

Here is how to change the monitor refresh rate:

1. Right-click on**any empty space** on your desktop and click**Display settings** .

### Fix 3: Disable Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel Support and Windows Error Reporting Service

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R**   at the same time. Then type **services.msc** and press**Enter** .

### Fix 4: Update the incompatible apps

 Some apps such as Norton AV, iCloud, and IDT Audio are known to cause compatibility issues in Windows and hence the screen flickering issue. If you have any of them installed, you should check their official website for an update to see if there’s a bug fixfor this in them.

 If you have installed any other app and the screen flashing issue occurs ever since then it’s very likely that app is to blame. Make sure it’s not malware and check its official website for an update if possible.
