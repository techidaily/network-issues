 Valorant’s been out for a while now, and there’re still many gamers reporting a**lag spikes** issue while refreshing kill records. If you’re also experiencing**high ping in Valorant** , don’t worry. Here’re some useful tricks that can help you resolve or mitigate this problem.

## Try these fixes:

 Here’re 7 fixes for your high ping issue with Valorant. You might not need to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Reboot your network](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Use an wired connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Close bandwidth hogging programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your network driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Change your DNS settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Reboot your network

 Whether you’re on WiFi or Ethernet, one of the easiest and quickest way to solve the network problem is to**restart your network** . It’ll free up RAM on your router and renew your IP address, which may also fix your high ping issue. Here’s how to do it:

1. Unplug both your**router** and**modem** .

wireless router
2. Wait**60 seconds** and plug them back in. Make sure the indicator lights are back to their normal state.
3. Launch Valorant and see if your problem goes away.

 Rebooting might only be a temporary solution. If you’re using a regular old router, consider upgrading to a gaming router such as[Asus RT-AC68U](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Dual-Band-AiMesh-Router-AC1900/dp/B00FB45SI4/?tag=drivereasycom-20) or[NETGEAR Gaming XR500](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-Ethernet-Wireless-Optimized/dp/B078GWJ44Z/?tag=drivereasycom-20) for better traffic control. 

 If you’re still having ping spikes after rebooting your network, check if you’re using Wi-Fi on your computer. If yes, take a look at the next fix. Otherwise jump to[the third fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 2: Use a wire connection

 Wi-Fi is convenient, and it’s good enough for regular web browsing. But when it comes to first person shooters, Wi-Fi is certainly not the perfect choice: poor reception, Wi-Fi channel conflict, there’re so many uncertainties about wireless connection. To avoid possible interference, we always recommend**making sure you’re on a wired connection** .

You should also make sure the cable is not broken.

 However, if you don’t have the option of shifting connection, you can check out the next fix below.

##  Fix 3: Close bandwidth-hogging programs

 It’s also important to make sure there aren’t any programs eating your bandwidth, as it could very well ruin your game. If your computer has background tasks like**OneDrive** ,**iCloud** and**Windows Update** that require a large bandwidth, be sure to close them before opening Valorant.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open the **Task Manager** .
2. Click the **Network** tab to sort tasks by bandwidth consumption. If you find any bandwidth-hogging tasks, select them and click **End Task** .

 When it’s done, open Valorant and see if this solves your high ping issue. If you continue to experience this problem, move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 4: Update your network driver

 According to some players, their ping times in Valorant have become stable after**updating their network driver** . So definitely check if you’re using the latest network driver. If not, you need to update it.

 This is particularly essential if you spend top dollar on a**gaming motherboard** . High-end motherboards usually come with some state-of-the-art features, some of which will improve the stability of your network. But you often need to unlock them with additional drivers.

 There are 2 ways you can update your network driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

#### Option 1: Update your network driver manually

 To update your network driver manually, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s official website and search for your model. Make sure you choose the latest driver that’s compatible with your version of Windows.

 If you don’t know what your model is or just want to fix the issue quickly, you can try to update your network driver automatically.

####  Option 2: Update your network driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

## Fix 5: Change your DNS settings

 There’s an IP address behind every domain, and DNS is basically a tool that translates the domain you’re visiting to its IP address. Changing your DNS server to a popular one reduces the resolve time and might as well improve your ping.

Here’s how to change your DNS settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the **Run** dialog. Type **control** and click**OK**  to open Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-box-dialog-control.jpg)
2. **View** the Control Panel **by Category** . Under **Network and Internet** section, click **View network status and tasks** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/control-panel-view-by-category-network-change-dns.jpg)
3. Click **Change adapter settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-control-adapter-settings-dns-3.jpg)
4. **Right-click** your current network and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ethernet-adapter-properties-dns-change.jpg)
5. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4)**  to view its properties.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-14_16-37-58-1.jpg)
6. Select **Use the following DNS server addresses** :. For **Preferred DNS server** , type **8.8.8.8** ; and for **Alternate DNS server** , type **8.8.4.4** . Click **OK**  to save the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-dns-server-click-5.jpg)  
 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are the most popular DNS servers maintained by Google.
7. For the changes to take effect, you need to flush the DNS cache. On your taskbar, type**cmd** in the search box. Select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-cmd-as-administrator.jpg)
8. In the pop-up window, type in**ipconfig /flushdns** . Press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cmd-ipconfig-flushdns.jpg)

 After changing your DNS server, open Valorant and check if the ping is stable. If this method doesn’t work for you, check out the next trick.

## Fix 6: Install all Windows updates

 There’re basically 2 types of update packages for Window 10: quality updates and version upgrades.

 Once you’ve completed this process, open Valorant and see if the ping spikes reappear. If yes, there’s still one last fix you can try.

## Fix 7: Use a VPN

 If you’ve tried almost everything and nothing seems to work, consider giving**VPN** a try.

 VPN servers usually deliver a better and more stable performance during peak hours. Note that**this does not apply to free VPNs** , as they are usually crowded during busy times. A paid and well-regarded VPN guarantees your smooth gaming experience.

Here are some VPN providers we recommend:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [ExpressVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [SurfShark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr.brandreward.com%2F%3Fkey%3D3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com%252Fdownload%252Fwindows%26id%3Ddrivereasy-en-120353)
