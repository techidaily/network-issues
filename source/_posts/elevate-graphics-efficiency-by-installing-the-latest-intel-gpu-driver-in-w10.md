2. [Download and update the driver automatically](#method2)

### **Method 1: Download and update the driver manually**

 Intel Graphics 3000 is not supported in Windows 10\.

 To download the latest Intel Graphics 3000 driver for Windows 7 or Windows 8, here’s what you need to do:

 1) Go to [Intel website](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81500/Intel-HD-Graphics-3000-for-2nd-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors) .

 2) Download the right driver according to the operating system that your PC is running (32-bit or 64-bit).
