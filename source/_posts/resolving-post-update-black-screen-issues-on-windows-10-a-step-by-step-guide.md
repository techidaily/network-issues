###  Fix 2: Unplug unnecessary USB equipment

 Sometimes black screens can be caused by**external devices** . To check for it, you can try disconnecting all your USB devices from your PC:

1. **Unplug** your external devices.
2. **Restart** your computer.
3. If the black screen has disappeared, you can**plug the devices back one at a time** to see which piece of hardware is causing this issue. Once you’ve identified the culprit, you can update the driver for that particular piece of hardware to better troubleshoot the black screen issue — Fix 3 may give you some tips about it.
If this produces no results, you can move on to Fix 3.

###  Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 Various reasons can trigger black screens after Windows 10 update, but the most common cause of it is**incompatible or outdated Windows drivers** .

 Then,**updating your graphics card driver** should do the trick. But you may wonder how it’s possible to update your graphics driver with a black screen. Don’t worry, generally, you’re able to start your PC in Safe Mode with networking to sort out the issue. If you don’t know how to**boot your computer into Safe Mode** , you can refer to **[this article](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — remember to press the**5** number key to**enter Safe Mode with networking** .

1. **[Start your PC in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
2. Once you log into your system,**right-click** the taskbar, then select**Task Manager** .

###  Fix 5: Log in using a different user account

 Black screens might also be caused by**corrupted Windows user profile** . To check for it, you can try restarting your PC in Safe Mode, then logging into Windows with a different user account, say, your working user account. If you can log in, it means your previous user account was causing the problem, then you can replace the folder of the problem user account with that of your working user account. Here’s what you need to do:

1. **[Restart your computer in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
2. Login with your working user account.
3. Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\{working-user-profile-name}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Caches** .
4. Copy the folder**Caches** .
5. Login with the corrupted user account.
6. Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\{broken-user-profile-name}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Caches** .
7. Replace the folder with the folder from the working user account.

 If you don’t have an existing working user account, you can**create a new account** . Here’s how: 

1. Make sure your Windows user account is an administrator. (If it’s not, you can refer to the instructions further down this page to activate the original administrator account and use it to login to Windows.
2. In the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**Start** button, then the**Settings** icon.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf28e24ef9b.jpg)
3. Click**Accounts** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf392ae53df.jpg)
4. Click**Other people** , then**Add someone else to this PC** . And follow the on-screen instructions to create a new user account.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf399963b71.jpg)
5. Log into this account and check to see if the black screen issue is resolved.

#### How to activate the original Windows administrator account

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows search box, right click**Command Prompt** , then select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf346d3db95.jpg)
2. Type **net user administrator /active:yes** and press**Enter** on your keyboard.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf34a620994.jpg)
3. **Restart** your computer and you’ll be able to log into Windows with the administrator account.
