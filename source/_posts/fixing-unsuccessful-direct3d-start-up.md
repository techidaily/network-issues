### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 Graphics card driver issues can cause the**failed to initialize Direct3D** issue. If the video driver in your computer is missing or out of date, it can result in this problem and stop running the application or game. So you should **update the graphics card driver** to fix the error.

**Manually update driver** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, find the exact graphics card driver for your graphics adapter, and install it in your Windows.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way. You need to know for sure the right driver online that matches your Windows OS, download it, and install it step by step.
