## What to do if my computer is screen upside down?

 Here are the fixes to try. You shouldn’t have to try them all. Just try each in turn until everything’s working again.

1. [Try keyboard shortcut combinations](#Fix1)
2. [Configure Display Settings](#Fix2)
3. [Update available drivers](#Fix3)

 Note: It’d be so uncomfortable to search on Google and follow the instruction if your computer/laptop screen turns upside down, so you can search on Google and read the instructions on another computer or mobile phone to go on.

### Fix 1: Try keyboard shortcut combinations

 Sometimes you might accidentally press the keyboard shortcut combinations to flip your**computer screen upside down,** so you can try to press the keyboard shortcut combinations to rotate your display screen to place normally. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the Keyboard shortcut combinations:**Ctrl** +**Alt** +**Up** **Arrow** ,**Ctrl** +**Alt** +**Down** **Arrow** ,**Ctrl** +**Alt** +**Left** **Arrow** , or**Ctrl** +**Alt** +**Right** **Arrow** .

 2) After pressing the keyboard shortcuts, see if your desktop screen rotates.

 If yes, keep pressing the keyboard shortcut combinations until it turns to the right screen orientation that you want.

 If not, it’s possible that the Hot Keys in your computer is disabled. Follow the instructions below to enable Hot Keys:

 1) Right click the empty area on your desktop, and click**Graphics** **Options** or something similar to that.

 2) Go to**Hot Keys** and make sure it’s**enabled** .

 3) Then try the keyboard shortcut combinations again to rotate your computer/laptop screen.

 This should help you fix the upside down screen. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions.

[If you’re using Windows 11, 10](#Step1)

[If you’re using Windows 8 and Windows 7](#Step2)

**If you’re using Windows 11, 10**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1912cecb794.jpg)

 You’ll need to try each one to flip your computer screen to a proper orientation.

 If you’re satisfied with the current orientation you selected, click**Keep changes** to save; if not, click**Revert** or just wait 15 seconds.

 Still no luck? Don’t be upset. There’s one more thing to try…

### Fix 3: Update available drivers

 The missing or updated drivers in your Windows computer can cause the screen upside down issue, so you should update your drivers to the latest version to fix the problem.

There are two options to update drivers:

 Option 1 – Manually: You can manually update your graphics card driver from the manufacturer, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

 Option 2 – Automatically: If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you will get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee).

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install the driver in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b166616338a7.jpg)

 4) After updating, restart your computer to take effect. Then check if your desktop screen works properly now.
