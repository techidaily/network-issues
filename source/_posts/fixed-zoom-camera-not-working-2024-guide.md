## [Fixed] Zoom Camera Not Working 2024 Guide

 It could be annoying when you login Zoom to attend an online meeting but the camera is not working. Don’t worry, this problem could be fixed. Read on to find how.

## Try these fixes

 There’re 4 fixes that have helped many gamers solve their problems. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Close other apps that have access to camera](#f1)
2. [Allow Zoom access to your camera](#f2)
3. [Update your camera driver](#f3)
4. [Reinstall the Zoom client](#f4)

### Fix 1: Close other apps that have access to camera

 Zoom may can’t access to camera if the webcam is currently used by another application. Other apps such as Discord may use the computer’s camera and cause the Zoom camera not working problem.

 Make sure that all other programs that utilize the camera are not using the camera or are closed. The easiest way is to close every application except Zoom. Then try Zoom camera to check if it works.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** +**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu. Then, click**Privacy** .

### Fix 3: Update your camera driver

 It’s possible the incorrect or outdated device drivers or graphic drivers cause the Zoom camera not working issue. In addition to fix the issue, updating drivers will improve your computer performance, so there’s nothing to worry about.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee**):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
