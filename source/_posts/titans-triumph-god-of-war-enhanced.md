### Fix 1: Check the system requirements

 Does your system meet minimum requirements? Before any complex fixes, check if your PC specifications first. If it’s not, you may encounter God of War performance issue.

| OS        | Windows 10 64-bit                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processor | Intel i5-2500k (4 core 3.3 GHz) or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 (4 core 3.1 GHz) |
| Memory    | 8 GB RAM                                                             |
| Graphics  | NVIDIA GTX 960 (4 GB) or AMD R9 290X (4 GB)                          |
| DirectX   | Version 11 (DirectX feature level 11\_1 required)                    |
| Storage   | 70 GB available space                                                |

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 God of War performance issue is related to the graphics. If you’re using a outdated or corrupted graphic driver, you might encounter performance issue. There are two ways to update your graphic driver, manually and automatically.

**Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites (**[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for graphics) and install it manually.

**Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the Update button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Fix 3: Verify game files

 Verifying the game files is a useful fix to solve game issues, especially when game are crashing or having terrible performance. As a new game, God of War has new patches roll out almost every day, verifying your game files may resolve installation corruption that prevents you from being able to play the game.

Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam client and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click **God of War** and select **Properties..** .

3. On the left, select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files** .. and wait for the process to complete.

4. Restart God of War and check if the issue persists.

If this doesn’t fix the problem, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 4: Check for system updates

 Windows 10/11 offers system updates regularly, which usually improves system stability and sometimes in-game performance. Normally it’s an automated process, but you can also check to make sure you have all the patches:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key and the I (i) key** to open the Windows Settings. Click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you’ve installed all the system updates, restart your computer and test the gameplay.

If the latest updates don’t work for you, try the next method.
