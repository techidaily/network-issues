## What is Microsoft Basic Render driver

 Microsoft Basic Render driver is the driver software for Microsoft Basic Display adapter, which provides your computer with the display and graphics capabilities when you don’t have the dedicated driver software installed for your graphics card.

 Usually Windows will use the graphics card driver installed officially for the video card in your computer. But if there’s something wrong with your dedicated graphics card driver, or if your computer chooses to use the Microsoft Basic display adapter, your system will use the Microsoft Basic display adapter instead of your own graphics card.

 To simply put, you can choose to use your dedicated graphics card and update your graphics card driver to fix your problems.

## Try these fixes

 Here are solutions you can try. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working again.

1. [Enable your dedicated graphics card](#F1)
2. [Update your graphics card driver](#F2)

 Note: the screenshots below come from Windows 10, and fixes apply to Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### Fix 1: Enable your dedicated graphics card

 If your own graphics card has been disabled or corrupted, your computer will automatically choose to use the Microsoft Basic Display adapter for GPU, in order to maintain the routine process in your system. So you should make sure that your graphics card is in good condition, and then enable your dedicated graphics card for Windows.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)**  and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. In Device Manager, double click**Display adapters** to expand it.

4. Restart your computer and see if it fixes your Microsoft Basic Render driver issue.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There’s something else to try.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 A missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause you with the Microsoft Basic Render driver, so you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You’ll need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the latest drive for your display adapter, and manually install in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.
