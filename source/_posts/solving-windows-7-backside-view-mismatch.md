3. Click**OK** .
This should restore your screen orientation. If not, or if you want to prevent this issue from happening again, you may need to try the method below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

You may have a screen upside down issue even if you didn’t do anything wrong. This is because your graphics driver is not working properly.
