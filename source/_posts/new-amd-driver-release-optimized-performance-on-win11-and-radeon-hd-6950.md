 Another graphics card designed for gamers: AMD Radeon HD 6950 ensures “unbelievable performance and flawless graphics for uncompromising gamers.”
  
 To ensure that you have a better gaming experience, it is strongly recommended that you constantly keep your graphics card driver updated.
  
 In this post, we will show you three more effective ways to update your Radeon HD 6950 graphics card driver, saving you bunch of time and energy.  
  
[**Option One: Update driver from device manager**](#1)
[**Option Two: Update driver manually**](#2)
[**Option Three: Update driver automatically (Recommended)**](#3)
  
 **Option One: Update driver from device manager**
  
 You should always consider getting your device drivers updated from Device Manager first, since the safest way for you to update your drivers is via Windows driver database. But the downside is, Windows driver database doesn’t really update that much, so there is a great chance that you are not getting the latest version of the device drivers.
  
 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .

 2) Locate and expand category **Display adapters** .

 3) Right click the **Radeon HD 6950**  display card driver and choose**Update Driver Software…** .

 4) Then choose**Search automatically for driver software** .

 5) Then wait for Windows to get the latest version of the graphics driver it can find.
  
 If you see the notification like the following one:

 Please move on to the second option to get your graphics card driver updated.
  
 **Option Two: Update driver manually**
  
 1) First, we need to go to**AMD support** website to download the correct graphics card driver for your computer.

 2) On the driver download webpage, scroll down a little bit to locate**Radeon HD 6000 series** section. Then choose the operating system that you are with accordingly. (We will go with**Windows 10 (64-bit)** .)
