## Fix 1: Delete temporary files

 As the name suggests, temporary files are the kind of files that store temporary data created by Windows or the programs that users use. But they take up some hard drive space which makes your computer slow, which can also impact the responsiveness to the connection. So to make your computer run smoother, you’re supposed to delete those files and it won’t cause any problems. Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type **%temp%** and then press **Enter** on your keyboard.

2. Delete all the files in the **temp**  folder. (Press **Ctrl**  and **A** at the same time to select all the files. Then right-click and select **Delete** .)

## Fix 4: Change your DNS server

 If releasing and renewing the IP address didn’t help you solve the issue, you can try changing the DNS server. It can be beneficial a lot of the time because the standard DNS your ISP gives you cannot always be within your expectations. So changing DNS servers settings, especially configuring Google Public DNS addresses would help you resolve some connectivity issues.

Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/win-11-run-control-panel.jpg)
2. View by **Category** , and select **Network and Internet** .

3. Select **Network and Sharing Center** .

* **[Surfshark](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
