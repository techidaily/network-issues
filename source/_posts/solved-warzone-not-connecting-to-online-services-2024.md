## Fix 1: Delete temporary files

 As the name suggests, temporary files are the kind of files that store temporary data created by Windows or the programs that users use. But they take up some hard drive space which makes your computer slow, which can also impact the responsiveness to the connection. So to make your computer run smoother, you’re supposed to delete those files and it won’t cause any problems. Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type **%temp%** and then press **Enter** on your keyboard.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files-1.jpg)
2. Delete all the files in the **temp**  folder. (Press **Ctrl**  and **A** at the same time to select all the files. Then right-click and select **Delete** .)

3. If a window pops up saying that **The action can’t be completed** , simply check the box **Do this for all current items** and click **Skip** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PC-delete-temp-files.jpg)
4. Now go to your **Recycling Bin**  from your desktop. Right-click on it and select **Empty Recycle Bin** .

5. Click **Yes** .

 After deleting the temp files, launch your game to check if you can finally get into the game. If the problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Release and renew IP address

 When you encounter the connectivity issue, one of the troubleshooting steps you should take is to release and renew the IP address of your computer, which can help refresh the internet connection.

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd** . Then click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-cmd-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click **Yes**  to continue.
3. In the command prompt window, type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-2.jpg)
4. Type **ipconfig /renew** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-3.jpg)

 Once done, close the Command Prompt. And you can try to launch your game. You probably would receive an error code on the loading screen. In this case, you can simply click to quit to the desktop. Then you can try again and click on the Play button from the Call of Duty: Warzon gaming title in your library and you should be able to connect to online services.

## Fix 4: Change your DNS server

 If releasing and renewing the IP address didn’t help you solve the issue, you can try changing the DNS server. It can be beneficial a lot of the time because the standard DNS your ISP gives you cannot always be within your expectations. So changing DNS servers settings, especially configuring Google Public DNS addresses would help you resolve some connectivity issues.

Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/win-11-run-control-panel.jpg)
2. View by **Category** , and select **Network and Internet** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/network-and-internet.png) .
3. Select **Network and Sharing Center** .

## Fix 5: Use a wired connection

 If you’re using Wi-Fi or wireless connection on your PC, it’s time for you to see if a wired connection will improve the situation. To do that, use a [**LAN cable**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LAN+cable&tag=drivereasycom-20) to connect your device to the router and restart the game to check if it resolves your issue.

## Fix 6: Link your Activision and Blizzard accounts

 Some players have found that linking their Activision and Blizzard accounts can let them get past the “connecting to online services” screen.

Here’s how:

1. Go to [**Activision**](https://s.activision.com/activision/login) ‘s website and login. Once you’re logged into your account, click **PROFILE**  located on the top-right corner.
2. In the **ACCOUNT LINKING**  section, find your profile and link it with your Battle.net account.  
![link Activision and Blizzard accounts](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/link-with-Battle.net-Accoutn.png)
3. Click **CONTINUE** . And you’ll be taken back to the Blizzard website to complete the account linking process.

## If your problem persists…

 If nothing else has worked for you, give VPNs a try. By connecting to a different server, you’re able to avoid bandwidth throttling. But be advised: lots of problems may arise if you use a free VPN. Therefore, to secure your network, we suggest you use a paid VPN.

 Below are the VPN apps that we recommend. By clicking on the links below, you may be able score nice savings on your subscriptions.

* [**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (up to 70% off)
* **[CyberGhost](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Surfshark](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 There are reports claiming that using a VPN might result in accounts being banned. To be safe, consider it as the last resort.
