## Fix 4: Reset the Winsock settings

**Winsock**  is a programming interface and supporting program in Windows operating system. It defines how Windows network software should access network services. If its data went wrong, this issue may occur.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key**   and **R**   at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd**   and press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Enter**   at the same time to **run**  **Command Prompt**  **as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes**  to run **Command Prompt** .
