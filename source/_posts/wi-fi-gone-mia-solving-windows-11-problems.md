 Be sure to choose the driver that’s   **compatible with your exact wireless network adapter model and your version of Windows** .

**Or**

 **Update the driver for your wireless network adapter automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

3. **Restart**  your PC to complete the reset.

## Fix 5: Replace your network interface controller card
