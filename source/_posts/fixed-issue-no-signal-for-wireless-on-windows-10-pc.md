## Fix 3: Update the driver for your wireless network adapter

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s   **compatible with your exact wireless network adapter model and your version of Windows** .

**Or**

## Fix 4: Reset the Winsock settings

Type **cmd**   and press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Enter**   at the same time to **run**  **Command Prompt**  **as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission.

3. **Restart**  your PC to complete the reset.
