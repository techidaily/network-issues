Then check to see if you can open it this time.

## Method 2: Update your graphics driver

The problem may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it is out of date. You can try reinstalling your graphics driver and see if this resolves the problem. If you are not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).**Driver Easy**will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
