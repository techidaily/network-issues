### Fix 1: Restore your monitor to the factory defaults

 Perhaps your monitor is blinking because the settings on your monitor are not correct. Try**restoring your monitor to the factory defaults** and see if this fixes your issues.

 You may need to consult the**manual** of your monitor for instructions on how to factory reset your monitor.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 You may be experiencing the monitor blinking issues because you are using a wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. In this case, you should update your graphics driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee**):
