 Or you can try the combination of Fn + F3 keys to see if it turns your Wi-Fi on and off.

 If you don’t see the Wi-Fi switch on your laptop, and the function keys don’t work, try to turn on the Wi-Fi feature in Settings. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time on your keyboard to open**Settings** .
2. Click**Network & Internet** on the left panel, and toggle the Wi-Fi button to**On** .

##  Fix 2: Make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running

 WLAN AutoConfig service (or Wireless Configuration in Windows XP) provides the logic required to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless local area network (WLAN). If this service is disabled, all the WLAN adapters on your computer won’t work properly. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running properly.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-94.png)
2. Scroll down and double-click**WLAN AutoConfig** .

##  Fix 3: Update your wireless network adapter

 If your wireless network adapter is missing or corrupted, your Acer laptop can’t connect to Wi-Fi. To rule it out as the cause for your network problem, you should update your wireless network adapter driver to the latest version.

**Note** : Since your Acer laptop won’t connect to Wi-Fi, you can try an Ethernet connection to update your driver, or download the driver into a USB drive in another computer with Internet access. 

 There are two ways to update your wireless network adapter driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* **Manually update your driver** : You can go to the website of your network adapter, search for the latest version of your wireless network adapter, then download and install it into your laptop.
* **Automatically update your driver** : If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

##  Fix 4: Modify Power Management settings

 Power Management settings for your wireless network adapter relate your Wi-Fi performance to the battery power situation. When your Acer laptop has less power, it may disable your wireless network adapter in order to save power. So you should check and modify the Power Management settings.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo ke** y and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

##  Fix 5: Reset network settings

1. In the search bar, type in “**cmd** ” and select **Run as admnistrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cmd-admin-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

   * **ipconfig /flushdns**  
   * **ipconfig /release**  
   * **ipconfig /renew**  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/flushdns.png)
3. Once this is done, close the Command Prompt window and see if you have an internet connection.

If the problem remains, please move on.

##  Fix 6: Allow Wi-Fi connections in your antivirus program

 Your antivirus program may stop your laptop from connecting to Wi-Fi, so you can temporarily turn off the antivirus program in your computer, and then try to connect to your Wi-Fi.

 If your Acer laptop succeeds in connecting to Wi-Fi, then your antivirus program is the culprit. In this case, you should add your Wi-Fi connection to the antivirus exception, and make sure to allow your Wi-Fi connection through the antivirus program.

Note: be sure to re-enable the antivirus program later on.

##  Fix 7: Manually connect to a wireless network

 If the methods above didn’t resolve your issue, you can try connecting to your Wi-Fi manually in your Acer laptop.

1. Type**Control Panel** in the search box on your desktop, and click**Control Panel** in the result.
