## 2\. Delete the game cache

 Another great way to troubleshoot your issue is by clearing the cache. Temporary files and data are often stored. But over time, this cached data might become corrupted, which can lead to issues with connectivity, game freezes, slow or unsuccessful game loads, and other performance issues. In this situation, you’ll need to clear the cache from the EST launcher. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .

## 5\. Repair your PC

 If none of the methods listed above help fix your issue, it’s time you check if you have corrupted system files, which significantly reduce PC performance. In this case, you can try running a scan of your PC. And for that job, we recommend you use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a **100% legitimate** program that specializes in Windows repair. When you run Fortect, it’ll automatically find, and fix system software issues without losing your data.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. Once it’s finished, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
