### Fix 3: Gently wipe the screen with cotton balls

 If the fixes above didn’t help with the problem, then it’s most likely a hardware problem. You can power off the computer and then gently wipe across the screen with cotton balls. Be sure to proceed with caution so as not to cause any further damage to your laptop.

 If all else fails, you might have to take it to a computer repair shop to have it looked at professionally.
