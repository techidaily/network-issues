###  Tip 1: Change the power option 

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the  operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. To adjust the power option to improve FPS: 

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4e6c91572.png)
2. Choose the **High performance** option.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4f0b203f9.jpg)

###  Tip 2: Adjust your PC for best performance

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features. So to tweak the settings: 

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and**Pause** at the same time and click**Advanced system settings** .

2. In **Advanced** , click **Settings** .

3. Click **Adjust for best performance** \> **Apply** \> **OK** .

###  Tip 3: Update your graphics driver

 Updating our graphics driver is also an important step in getting the best performance out of our graphics card (sometimes by a whopping 30%!). There’re two ways you can update your device drivers — manually or automatically:

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions. 

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. 

 You can update your drivers automatically with either [**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)
3. You can upgrade to **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b594602cca14.jpg) You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

###  Tip 4: Do a disk clean-up 

**Disk Clean-up**   is a built-in tool in Windows that helps us delete unimportant and junk files. To run **Disk Clean-up** :

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time. Then copy & paste **c:\\windows\\SYSTEM32\\cleanmgr.exe /cDrive**   into the box and click **OK** .![](https://www.supereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3ee1e0c3be4.png)
2. Choose **the drive** you want to free up storage and click **OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://www.supereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3ee278de5da.png)
3. Technically, you can tick all **the boxes** . You might also need to check out **Recycle Bin** and see if there’s anything to be restored first. Then click **OK** .  

![](https://www.supereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3ee2de770cf.png)
4. Make sure the ticked files are the ones you no longer want and click **Delete Files** to confirm.

###  Tip 5: Defrag your hard drive

 As we constantly add and remove files on our hard drives, small packets of information can end up in random places. This may result in our computer having to check multiple places for those pieces, hence the longer file opening/loading time, boot-up time etc. So we might have to defrag our hard drive to solve this and give our computer performance a boost. Here’s how: 

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png) and **R**   at the same time. Then type **dfrgui.exe**   in the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b88ba248c03c.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. Click to select **a drive**   and click **Analyze** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b88bcf4ad7f9.jpg)  
 Note that the **Analyze** button for an SSD (**Solid State Drive**) is grayed out simply because the drive doesn’t need/have spinning parts to find all the pieces of information, hence no time lag.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Wait until the analysis completes and **the fragmentation percentage**   of the selected drive will be displayed on **Current status** .
3. Click **Optimize**   if Windows tell you to optimize the drive. Usually the recommended percentage is 5% or higher.
4. Wait until the Windows defragments the drive successfully and **restart**   your computer.
