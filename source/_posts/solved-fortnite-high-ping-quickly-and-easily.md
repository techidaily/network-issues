## Fix 1: Restart Fortnite

 This is the quickest and easiest fix to try when you run into Fortnite high ping issue. Just**exit Fortnite and restart your game** . 

 Now run the game again and test to see if its ping is still high. If so, move on to Fix 2, below.

## Fix 2: Reboot your network

 One of the easiest fixes for high ping issues is to simply**restart your network** . By rebooting your network, your Internet connection speed may be back to normal. So maybe it will also resolve the high ping issue. Here is how to do it: 

**Unplug** your modem (and your wireless router, if it’s a separate device) from power for **60 seconds** .

wireless router

**Plug in** your network devices again and wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state. 

 Launch Fortnite to see if ping spikes in Fortnite again. If the high ping issue reappears after you reboot your network, try the next fix, below. 

##  Fix 3: Close bandwidth-hogging applications

If you’re running other applications like **OneDrive** , **Dropbox,**  and   **iCloud**  that require an Internet connection to download and upload files, or if your family members are watching TV shows at the same time, the high ping issue may occur when you’re in the middle of playing Fortnite. 

 To resolve this issue, you need to close those bandwidth-hogging applications. Here is how to do it: 

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** , **Shift,** and **Esc** at the same time to open the **Task Manager** .
2. **Right-click** the bandwidth-hogging applications and then select **End task** .

 Launch Fortnite to see if this issue reappears. If this issue reappears, don’t worry. Try the next fix, below. 

## Fix 4: Update your network driver

 An outdated or missing network driver may also trigger the high ping issue. **Try updating your network driver**   and maybe this issue can be fixed.

 There are two ways to update your network driver: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Update your network driver manually**  – You can update your network driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your network adapter. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact network adapter model and your version of Windows. 

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

## Fix 8: Use a VPN

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above but nothing seems to work, consider using a **VPN** .

**Note:** Do not use those so-called free VPNs, as they are not safe, and they are always crowded during busy times.

 A paid and reliable VPN usually delivers a better and more stable performance during peak hours, so it guarantees your smooth gaming experience.

Here are some VPN providers we recommend:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [ExpressVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
