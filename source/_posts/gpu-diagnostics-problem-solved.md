But with the Pro version it takes only**2** clicks (and you get**full support**and a**30-day money back guarantee**):**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and Install**Driver Easy**.**2)** Run**Driver Easy**and hit the **Scan Now**button.**Driver Easy**will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a3cbf61b437.jpg) **3)** Click on the**Update**button next to the graphics card to download the latest and correct driver for it.
