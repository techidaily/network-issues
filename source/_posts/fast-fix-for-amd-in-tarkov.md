## 2\. Delete the game cache

 Another great way to troubleshoot your issue is by clearing the cache. Temporary files and data are often stored. But over time, this cached data might become corrupted, which can lead to issues with connectivity, game freezes, slow or unsuccessful game loads, and other performance issues. In this situation, you’ll need to clear the cache from the EST launcher. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

## 3\. Clean your temp folder

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .
