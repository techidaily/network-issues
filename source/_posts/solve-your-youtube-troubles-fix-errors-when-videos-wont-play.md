2. Open a video in YouTube and see if it displays without fail.

###  Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Another common cause of the**YouTube video not showing** issue is an outdated or corrupt graphics driver on your system. So you should update the graphics driver to see if it fixes the problem.

 There’re two ways you can update your device drivers — 

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions. 

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. 

 You can update your drivers automatically with either [**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

###  Fix 4: Change the hardware acceleration

**Hardware Acceleration**  is a feature in  browsers  that tasks GPU with all the graphics and text rendering, hence giving us a better video playing and watching experience. 

 But sometimes it’s also the culprit of this **video not showing on YouTube** issue in **Google Chrome**   and **Firefox** , while it’s the exact OPPOSITE for the**Internet Explorer** browser. 

 So to disable hardware acceleration in Chrome and Firefox and enable it in **Internet Explorer** : 

**[I’m using Google Chrome](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :** 

**[I’m using Firefox](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [:](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 

**[I’m using Internet Explorer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :** 

 **I’m using Google Chrome :** 

1. In Chrome, in the top right corner, click on  the **three vertical dots**  button >   **Settings**  . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581a513db47.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Advanced** . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b582452d2feb.png)

3. Scroll down to the bottom and in **System** and**DISABLE** the toggle next to **Use hardware acceleration when available** . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581b3de44bc.jpg)

###  Fix 5: Delete the app data

###  Fix 6: Update your browser

 If this video-not-showing issue only happens in one specific browser, then you might want to update the browser to the latest version to see if it resolves the problem. Since a newer version is always designated to fix bugs in the earlier version and optimize. Here we take Chrome as an example:

 Updating your browser will not touch any of your browser settings or data, and is considered as a safe option in most cases. To do so:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \> **About Google Chrome** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b433a86ba999.jpg)
3. Google Chrome automatically detects if there’s an update available:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

* If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.
* If no, delete Chrome and re-install it on Windows store or other trustworthy third-party website. (**NOTE** : This will erase your Chrome browser settings and data).

 4) Again stream some video content on YouTube and see if it plays smoothly.
