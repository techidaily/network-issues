If the touch screen of your Lenovo laptop or tablet cannot work properly, you are not alone. Many Lenovo laptop users are reporting it. The touch screen of your device does not respond to your touches. But the good news is you can still fix it. This article gives you 5 solutions to try. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works. **1)[Restart your device](#a)**   **2) [Update or reinstall your touch screen driver](#b)**   **3)[Reset your operating system](#c)**   **4)[Contact the Lenovo support](#d)**

## 1) Restart your device

The simplest fix to it is to**restart your device**. It can clear the corruption issues on your computer and fix your touch screen. You can try doing so and see if it resolves your problem.

## 2) Update or reinstall your touch screen driver

The problem of your touch screen may be caused by an old or incorrect touch screen driver. You can update your touch screen driver manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).**Driver Easy**will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or**Pro**version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only**2** clicks (and you get**full support**and a**30-day money back guarantee**):**a)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and Install**Driver Easy**.**b)** Run**Driver Easy**and hit the **Scan Now**button.**Driver Easy**will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 3) Reset operating system

There may be faulty files or configurations in the operating system on your Lenovo device that stops your touch screen from working properly. You may need to**reset**or**reinstall**your operating system to fix the problem. If you are using**Windows 10**, you can check [**this guide**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to learn how to reset your operating system. If you are using a Windows system **other than Windows 10**, you can use a Windows installation media to reinstall your operating system.

## 4) Contact Lenovo support

If none of the methods above helps you fix the non-responsive touch screen, you may need to contact the **Lenovo customer service**. They can help you solve the problem or have your device repaired or replaced.
