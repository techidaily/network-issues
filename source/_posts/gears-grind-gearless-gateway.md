## 1\. Check the server status

 To narrow down the source of the problem, the first thing you need to do is to check the [Epic Games status page](https://status.epicgames.com/) .

 If there are known server issues going on, they are usually visible on the page. If the problem is not from the server’s end, try the fixes below.

## 2\. Use a wired connection

 To download large files efficiently, a wired connection is preferable over a wireless connection to the internet. Wireless connections are most susceptible to interference and aren’t as consistent as wired connections. Therefore, if possible, use a wired connection.

 However, if you are not able to opt for a wired connection, check out the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 3\. Disconnect other devices

 The download issue is sometimes caused by your router struggling with the number of connections due to too many downloads happening simultaneously. To work around this, you need to first restart your router. Simply unplug your router or modem from its power outlet. Wait for 15-20 seconds, then plug it back in.

 If you have other devices connected to your Wi-Fi, disconnect them while you’re downloading games.

 When it’s all done, resume your download and check if it helps you fix the issue. If you’re still experiencing slow download speed or the download is stuck at a certain percent, proceed to the next fix.
