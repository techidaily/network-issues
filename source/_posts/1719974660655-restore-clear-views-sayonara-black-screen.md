## Restore Clear Views, Sayonara Black Screen

 If you turn on your**Lenovo laptop** only for it to show nothing but a**black screen** , don’t panic. It’s often not hard to fix at all…

## How to fix Lenovo Laptop Black Screen in Windows 11, 10 and 8

 Here are 6 fixes that have helped other users resolve the Lenovo Laptop Black Screen problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Reset the display mode](#F1)**
2. **[Hard reset your Lenovo laptop](#F2)**

 Sometimes the black screen is only a glitch when the operating system loses its connection to the screen display. So whenever this happens, the first thing you can try is to press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-logo-key-5.png) , the**Ctrl** key, the**Shift** key, and**B** at the same time. This will reset the connection so that the operating system regains the display.

 Once finished, check to see if you get the normal display back on your Lenovo laptop. If yes, then great! If it still gives you the black screen, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Hard reset your Lenovo laptop

 Peripheral devices that are connected to your Lenovo laptop could also be the cause of the black screen issue. If this is the case for you, you may notice that the dots are spinning during the boot-up process. So you should perform a hard reset on your Lenovo laptop to narrow down the possibilities.

Here is how to do it:

1) Turn off your Lenovo laptop.

2) Unplug the power cord, remove the battery, and disconnect all external connected peripheral devices from your laptop.

3) Leave your laptop off for 30 seconds.

4) Press and hold the power button for about 60 seconds.

5) Put your battery back in the laptop and connect the power cord.

6) Turn on your laptop and check if it boots up properly.

* **If it boots up fine** , then congrats – you’re close to finding the culprit (i.e. one of the peripherals). You can then turn off your laptop, and plug in the peripherals one at a time until you can reproduce the black screen.

 If this method fixes your black screen issue, you should [**update your graphics driver**](#F3) to prevent this issue from happening again.

* **If the screen is still black** , the issue isn’t with the peripherals. You should move on to**Fix 3** , below to continue the troubleshooting.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Ctrl** , **Shift,** and **Esc** keys at the same time to open**Task Manager** .

### Fix 5: Disable fast startup

 Fast startup is a new feature in Windows 10 that enables your computer to boot up faster by saving the operating system state to a hibernation file. However, this does not always work perfectly and it sometimes can mess up with the startup process and cause the screen to go black.

So you can try disabling fast startup to see if it does the trick:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, type **powercfg.cpl** and press**Enter** .

### Fix 6: Perform a system restore

 If this black screen issue occurs only recently when you have made some changes to your computer, such as installing a new program or running a Windows update, chances are these changes are not very compatible with the operating system and trigger the black screen problem. So you should perform a system restore to revert your laptop to a previous state before these changes.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type**system restore** , then click on**Create a restore point** once it shows up as a matching result.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-571.png)

 2) In the **System Protection** tab, click **System Restore…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-572.png)

 3) Read the on-screen descriptions about what a system restore will do and will not do and click**Next** to continue.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-573.png)

 3)_Tick_ **the box** for**Show more restore points** and select the **restore point** that you want to use to revert your computer to and click**Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-574.png)

 4) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the system restore process.
