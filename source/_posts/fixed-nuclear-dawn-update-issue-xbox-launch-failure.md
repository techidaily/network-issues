## [FIXED] Nuclear Dawn Update Issue - Xbox Launch Failure

 Halo Infinite is a great game but it is really annoying when you get a DirectX12 error and can’t launch the game. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. This post has gathered fixes to solve the error and help you play the game. Read on to find how.

## Try these fixes

1. [Download DX12 file](#fix)
2. [Update your graphic driver](#fix1)
3. [Check your PC specs](#fix2)
4. [Edit your file name](#fix3)
5. [Repair system files](#fix4)

### Fix 1: Download DX12 file

 Before moving to any complicated fixes, make sure you’ve downloaded and installed the latest DX12 files.

 If not, go to the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) and download the latest version.

### Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 According to the error message from Halo Infinite, apparently, you need to update the graphics driver to the latest version to meet the requirements.

| **Manufacturer** | **Supported driver**                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AMD              | Halo Infinite Day Zero Driver 21.12.1 (Recommended) All AMD graphics drivers    |
| NVIDIA           | 497.09 or later (Recommended) All NVIDIA graphics drivers                       |
| Intel            | All Intel graphics driver Intel graphics hardware is not supported at this time |

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 Manufacturers like NVIDIA release new graphics drivers on a regular basis. You can spend some time heading to the driver’s official website and updating the driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note you should download the latest driver that’s compatible with your operating system. After that, follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver.  
 The process is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. If you want to free yourself, the second option would help.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly. You don’t need to worry about making a mistake when downloading or installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

 Restart your computer for the changes to take effect, then relaunch Halo Infinite.

### Fix 3: Check your PC specification

 Some gamers have reported that they’ve installed DirectX 12 and the latest graphics driver, but the error persists. If you’re in this situation, you need to check your PC specifications again.

#### Minimum Requirements

| OS   | Windows 10 RS5 x64 1809 (October 2018 update) |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| CPU  | AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel i5-4440             |
| GPU  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti              |
| VRAM | 4+ GB                                         |
| RAM  | 8+ GB                                         |
| SSD  | 50+ GB                                        |

You need to check 2 elements:

* DirectX 12 feature levels
* VRAM

 Either your VRAM is less than 4GB, or DirectX 12 feature level is less than 12\_0 will stop you from playing the game.

 If your VRAM meets the minimum requirements but encounters the error message, the culprit should be DirectX12 level. Because Halo Infinite requires 12\_0 or higher to run the game.

 To find out if your system is compatible with DirectX 12 and the DirectX 12 levels, just follow the steps below:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type`dxdiag` and press the**Enter** key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dxdiag.jpg)
3. In the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, check the**DirectX Version** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/directx12-1.jpg)
4. Go to the**Display 1** tab, and it will show you the version of Direct3D and the supported feature levels.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/directx12-2.jpg)  
 Also, you can check your VRAM on the left panel.

If your Feature Level is lower than 12\_0, you’ll need a new GPU.

### Fix 4: Edit your file name

 We don’t know the reason but many gamers have tried and it worked for some people. If you’re a Steam user, you can give it a try, it may surprise you.

1. Open File Explorer, find the steam library where you downloaded the game.
2. Go to`C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\MGS Test App 6\data\hardware` The file directory may vary depending on where you installed the game.
3. Find the text file that is applicable to you, then rename this text file to anything you want. **Make sure to create a copy of the file before making any changes to it.**
4. Attempt to relaunch the game.  
**Note** : The game takes some time to load up, just wait for a few minutes when you see a black screen and 3 dots at the top left.

If this fix doesn’t work, move to the next one.

### Fix 5: Repair system files

 If your system files are missing or broken, you’ll encounter various issues including the game not launching issue.
