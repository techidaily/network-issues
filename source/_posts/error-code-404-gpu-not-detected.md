### Fix 3: Delete the config.dat file of your game

 The Config.dat file is created by the game manufacturer that primarily stores settings that are chosen via the game’s settings menu. Generally speaking, the Config.dat file resides here: Documents\\My Games\\the name of your game (like Terraria).

 1) Go to**Documents**  \>**My Games** .

2) Click the file named after your game (like Terraria)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e84ba650fb2.jpg)

 3) Right click the**config.dat** file, click**delete** , and click**Yes** . (Please don’t worry. This will not affect your game. And it will download the Config.dat file again when you play it.)
