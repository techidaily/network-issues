 If you find your computer**screen is blurry** , don’t worry. You can fix the**blurry screen issues**  quickly and easily.

## Why is my monitor blurry?

 The blurry screen issues present with different symptoms, so you may get**blurry text** on your display, or**apps are blurry** , especially on the external monitor. Sometimes you may see**blurry fonts** on your computer, and that’s one of the problems for the blurry screens.

 With that said, the reasons for the blurry screen issue are different. If the screen resolutions are different in two displays, apps or text will become blurred if you move them from one monitor to another. And the monitor driver issue can also cause a blurry screen.

 But don’t worry. We will help you fix your problem and get a clear screen.

## Try these fixes

 Before you try, ensure to keep your monitor screen**clean and dry** . If you’re using multiple displays, remember to adjust all the monitor screen resolutions to the same.
