### Fix 1: Re-enable your screen

 Your laptop screen may have accidentally been disabled. You should re-enable your laptop screen so you’re able to use it.

 To re-enable your laptop screen, try pressing**Fn** and**F1/F2/F4/…** (the function key that turns on/off your laptop screen) on your keyboard.

 You may consult the manual of your laptop to know the function key that enables/disables your laptop screen.

 Now check to see if you’re able to turn on your laptop screen. If not, don’t worry. There are still other fixes for you to try…

### Fix 2: Connect your laptop to an external monitor

 If your laptop screen is still not working, you should try connecting your laptop to a monitor. If the external monitor is working, then there are a few things you should try:

#### 1\. Update your device drivers

 Your laptop screen issue may be caused by wrong or outdated device drivers. To see if that’s the case for you, you should try updating your device drivers.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to_each device_ to download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all the drivers. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

#### 2\. Update your laptop BIOS

**BE CAREFUL!** This may require some advanced computer skills. And your laptop may stop working properly if you do this wrong. So if you’re not sure you can do it yourself, you should ask an expert for help, or just move on to the next fix.

 It is also possible that your laptop**BIOS** (**basic input/output system** , the bridge between your Windows system and your laptop hardware) is wrong or outdated, so your laptop screen is not working properly. To fix this issue, you should try updating your laptop BIOS.

 Get the latest update of your laptop BIOS from your laptop manufacturer website. Then install the update by following the instructions the website provides. After that, restart your laptop to see if this works for you.

 If the methods above still didn’t repair your laptop screen, you may need to…
