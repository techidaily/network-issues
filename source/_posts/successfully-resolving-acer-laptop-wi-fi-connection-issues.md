1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time on your keyboard to open**Settings** .
2. Click**Network & Internet** on the left panel, and toggle the Wi-Fi button to**On** .

##  Fix 2: Make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running

 WLAN AutoConfig service (or Wireless Configuration in Windows XP) provides the logic required to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless local area network (WLAN). If this service is disabled, all the WLAN adapters on your computer won’t work properly. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running properly.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-94.png)
2. Scroll down and double-click**WLAN AutoConfig** .  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-95.png)
3. Make sure to set the**Startup type** to**Automatic** , and the**Service status** is**Running** . Then click**Apply** and**OK** to save the changes.  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-96.png)
4. Restart your laptop and connect to Wi-Fi.

Now check if your Acer laptop connects to Wi-Fi or not.

If not, don’t panic. There are other solutions.

##  Fix 3: Update your wireless network adapter

 If your wireless network adapter is missing or corrupted, your Acer laptop can’t connect to Wi-Fi. To rule it out as the cause for your network problem, you should update your wireless network adapter driver to the latest version.

**Note** : Since your Acer laptop won’t connect to Wi-Fi, you can try an Ethernet connection to update your driver, or download the driver into a USB drive in another computer with Internet access. 

 There are two ways to update your wireless network adapter driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* **Manually update your driver** : You can go to the website of your network adapter, search for the latest version of your wireless network adapter, then download and install it into your laptop.
* **Automatically update your driver** : If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

##  Fix 4: Modify Power Management settings

 Power Management settings for your wireless network adapter relate your Wi-Fi performance to the battery power situation. When your Acer laptop has less power, it may disable your wireless network adapter in order to save power. So you should check and modify the Power Management settings.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo ke** y and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-409.png)
2. In Device Manager, double-click**Network adapters** , and right-click on your**wireless network adapter** , and select**Properties** .  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-410.png)
3. Click the**Power Management** tab, and uncheck the box next to**Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** . Then click**OK** .

##  Fix 5: Reset network settings

 Corrupted DNS caches can prevent you from connecting to the internet because it can cause a mismatch in your IP address. So you might need to flush the DNS cache to fix the Acer laptop no Wi-Fi issue. To do so:

1. In the search bar, type in “**cmd** ” and select **Run as admnistrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cmd-admin-1.jpg)
2. Now type in the following commands and hit **Enter**  after each one.  

   * **ipconfig /flushdns**  
   * **ipconfig /release**  
   * **ipconfig /renew**  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/flushdns.png)
3. Once this is done, close the Command Prompt window and see if you have an internet connection.

If the problem remains, please move on.

##  Fix 6: Allow Wi-Fi connections in your antivirus program

 Your antivirus program may stop your laptop from connecting to Wi-Fi, so you can temporarily turn off the antivirus program in your computer, and then try to connect to your Wi-Fi.

 If your Acer laptop succeeds in connecting to Wi-Fi, then your antivirus program is the culprit. In this case, you should add your Wi-Fi connection to the antivirus exception, and make sure to allow your Wi-Fi connection through the antivirus program.

Note: be sure to re-enable the antivirus program later on.
