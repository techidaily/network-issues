In this article, we’ll point you in the direction of what is going on and how to fix it.

 Before diving into any troubleshooting, simply restart your game and router. If this didn’t work, try these fixes:

1. **[Check your game’s server status](#fix1)**
2. **[Allow your game through Windows Firewall](#fix2)**
3. **[Run your game and launcher as an administrator](#fix3)**

5. **[Flush your DNS and use Google’s instead](#dns)**
6. **[Make sure your Activision and Blizzard accounts are linked](#fix5)**

## Fix 1: Check your game’s server status

 Game servers may sometimes go down and you cannot connect to online services. To check if that’s your case, visit the [Activision Online Services page](https://support.activision.com/uk/en/onlineservices) . Once you go there, take these steps:

## Fix 2: Allow your game through Windows Firewall

 The error message is mainly associated with a server or internet connection issue. So in order to fix it, you need to first make sure that your firewall is not blocking your game. To do this, take these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key to open the Start menu. Then type in**windows firewall** and click **Windows Defender Firewall**  from the results.  
![Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows-firewall-1.jpg)
2. From the left panel, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![allow an app through windows defender firewall](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-an-app-through-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)
3. Now you need to scroll down until you can find**Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War** . And also make sure it’s ticked for Private.  
![allow Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War through Windows Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-the-game-through-Windows-Firewall.jpg)

 If your game isn’t on the list and it’s not ticked for Private, it means it doesn’t have access to the internet. If that’s your case, take these steps:

1. Click on**Change settings > Allow another app…** .  

![allow black ops cold war through windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-black-ops-cold-war-through-windows-firewall.jpg)
2. Then browse for our game and follow the instructions to allow your game through the firewall.

If you are not sure where your game is installed, take these steps:

1. Open BLIZZARD.
2. Click on**GAMES** and head to**Call of Duty: BOCW** . Click on**Options > Show in Explorer** . Then you’ll be brought to your game’s installation directory.  

![call of duty black ops cold war installation directory](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-the-game-as-administrator.jpg)

* Open the folder**Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War** . Then you’ll find**BlackOpsColdWar.exe** .

 After you’ve added your game to the list and ticked it for Private, try to boot up your game. And you should be able to connect.

## Fix 3: Run your game and launcher as an administrator

### Run your game as an administrator

1. Open BLIZZARD.
2. Click on**GAMES** and head to**Call of Duty: BOCW** . Click on**Options > Show in Explorer** . Then you’ll be brought to your game’s installation directory.  
![call of duty black ops cold war installation directory](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-the-game-as-administrator.jpg)
3. Open the folder**Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War** . Then you’ll find**BlackOpsColdWar.exe** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .
4. Select the tab**Compatibility** and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .  
![run Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War as an administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/run-the-game-as-administrator-Properties-window.jpg)

## Fix 5: Flush your DNS and use Google’s instead

 Sometimes your ISP-supplied DNS server might be slow or not properly configured for caching, which can effectively slow your connection and even cause problems like games not connecting to server error. Switching your DNS can result in better connectivity and performance for your internet connection. Here we recommend using Google DNS.

To see if a new DNS address helps, you can follow the instructions below:

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd** . Then click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-cmd-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click **Yes**  to continue.
3. In the command prompt window, type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-2.jpg)
4. Type **ipconfig /renew** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-3.jpg)
5. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/win-11-run-control-panel.jpg)
6. View by **Category** , and select **Network and Internet** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/network-and-internet.png) .
7. Select **Network and Sharing Center** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/network-and-sharing-center.png)
8. Click the Internet connection you’re using, then select **Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-44.png)
9. Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP /IPv4)** **\> Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/change-DNS-server-Internet-Protocol-Version.jpg)
10. Click **Use the following DNS server addresses:**  

 For **Preferred DNS server** , type **8.8.8.8**  
 For **Alternate DNS server** , type **8.8.4.4**  

 Check the box next to **Validate settings upon exit**  and then click **OK** .

## Fix 6: Make sure your Activision and Blizzard accounts are linked

 If you haven’t linked your Activision and Blizzard accounts, you may not be able to connect to the online services. So to eradicate the error message, follow the steps below to link your accounts:

1. Head across to [activision.com](https://www.activision.com/) .
2. In the top right, click**LOGIN** .  
![link activision account](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LOGIN-activision-account.jpg)
3. Then you’ll be redirected to the login page. Now simply enter your details.
4. Once you’re logged in, click**PROFILE** in the top right.  
![activision profile](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activision-profile.jpg)
5. If you haven’t linked with your Battle.net Account, simply click on it and follow the on-screen instructions to link your account.  

![link with battle.net account](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/link-the-account-Battle.net_.jpg)

 After you’ve done these, launch your game and check if you can connect to online services.

 Still no luck? Then give VPNs a try. A trustworthy VPN can decrease your ping and thus provide you with a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience. And by connecting a VPN server to the remote game server, you’re able to avoid bandwidth throttling. But be advised: lots of problems may arise if you use a free VPN. Therefore, to secure your network and maximize your gaming experience, we suggest you use a paid VPN.

Below is the VPN we would like to recommend:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 There are reports claiming that using a VPN might result in accounts being banned. To be safe, consider it as the last resort.
