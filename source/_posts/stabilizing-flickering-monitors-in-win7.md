 If your computer screen flickers frequently, it’s really annoying. But don’t worry, you can try the fixes below to solve the problem. They have worked for many Windows users.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your drivers](#f1)**
2. **[Check for hardware issues](#f2)**
3. **[If you use Adobe Flash and Java, uninstall them](#f3)**

### Fix 1: Update your drivers

 The screen of your Windows computer may flicker or blink frequently if your device drivers are faulty or outdated. You can update your device drivers, especially your graphics and chipset drivers, and see if this fixes your problem.

 There are two ways to update your graphics and chipset drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .

### Fix 2: Check for hardware issues

 It’s also possible that your screen flickering problem results from interference from outside or defective cable connection.

To troubleshoot these hardware issues:

1. Make sure that there is no **magnet** around your computer — magnetic field can make your screen blink.
2. You should also check if the **cables** are connected properly to your screen or monitor. You can gently swing your screen and see if it flickers. If it does, you need to reconnect those cables.

### Fix 3: If you use Adobe Flash and Java, uninstall them

### Fix 4: Update your BIOS

 The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) on your computer manages the communication between your hardware and your operating system. It may cause your screen to flicker or blink if it’s outdated. You can try updating your BIOS to troubleshoot your screen flickering problem.

**IMPORTANT:** Be extra careful about updating your BIOS, and always back up your data before doing it. If you make a mistake or if an error occurs, your computer may become unusable and you may lose your data.

1. Go to**System Information** to get detailed information about your computer:  
   1. Type **msinfo32**  in the Windows search box and press**Enter** on your keyboard.  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b91080612181.png)  
   2. At System Information, you can view the information of your**System Manufacturer** and**System Model** .  

   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9108627406a.jpg)
2. Type**your system’s manufacturer name** ,**your system’s model name** and**BIOS** in the Google search box, then select the matching result to go to the manufacturer’s official website to download BIOS update.

3. Look for words or sections like**Updates** ,**Downloads** , or**Support** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b910c00d25e0.jpg)
4. Verify the update file is**newer** than the BIOS version that you see in System Information. Otherwise, there would be no need to download the update file.

5. When the download is finished, make sure your computer is plugged in, then double-click on the downloaded file.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Note:** If there’re any instructions available in the downloaded file, make sure you follow the instructions strictly to update your BIOS. Or you can visit your BIOS manufacturer’s support site for a direct explanation of how to do so.
6. Transfer the BIOS update file to a USB drive and keep the drive connected to your computer.
7. Click the**Start** button > **power icon** \>**Restart** .
