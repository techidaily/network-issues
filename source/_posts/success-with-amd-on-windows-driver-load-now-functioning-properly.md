 2) Make sure that your computer is fully updated from**Windows Update** (in**Start** button**\> Settings > Update & Security**). Please pay extra attention to the C++ and [**.NetFrameworks**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) upgrades.

 You may want to restart your computer when the uninstall finishes.
  
 5) Now we are moving on to update your drivers manually. Go to **[support website of AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)**  and search for the correct graphics driver for your system. If you are not sure what driver you need, you can choose the option on the left so the automatic detect will help you locate the exact driver.
