### **Fix 1: Remove battery & long-press power button (laptops only)**

If you’re on a laptop:

1) Shut down your laptop.

2) Remove its battery.

3) While the battery is out, press and hold the power button for 60 seconds.

4) Put the battery back in and start your PC again.

 If this doesn’t work (or you’re on a desktop PC), try Fix 2 below.

### **Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers**

 It’s quite likely that your black screen problem is caused by an outdated, corrupt or incorrect video driver. As updating your drivers is quite an easy task (and something you should do, anyway, for the general health of your computer), it should be one of the first fixes you try.

 If you’re good with computers, and you’re confident playing around under the hood, you can update your drivers manually by visiting the manufacturer websites for all your devices and cards, finding the right drivers for your operating system and version of Windows, and manually downloading and installing them.

 But if you’re not particularly good with computers, you don’t want to risk installing the wrong thing, or you just want to save a LOT of time, **you can update your video driver (and all your other drivers) automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. Here’s how:

 1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [**Restart your computer in Safe Mode with Network**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 3) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 4) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version of Driver Easy).

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All – the Pro version comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee).

 e.g. Here’s a screenshot of the Intel HD Graphics 4400\. Your results will show your graphics card.

### **Fix 3: Disable fast startup**

 Disabling Fast Startup may resolve the black screen problem. Here’s how to do it:

 1) [**Restart your computer in Safe Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .

 2) Press Control Panel in the search box at the bottom corner of the desktop, and click**Control Panel** in the pop-up menu.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583410000c57d.jpg)
  

 2) View by “Small icons” and click**Power Options** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_5834100832c9c.jpg)
  

 3) Click**Choose what the power button does** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_5834100da71f1.jpg)
  

 4) Click**Change settings that are currently unavailable** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583410125bde7.jpg)
  

 5) Under “Shutdown settings”, uncheck**Turn on fast startup (recommended)** then click**Save changes** .

### **Fix 4: Disable integrated graphics card**

 If you have a separate graphics card, your computer may think it has a dual monitor, which can cause the black screen + mouse pointer problem. In this case, disabling the integrated graphics card may fix the problem.

 1) [**Restart your computer in Safe Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a516b53b983.png)** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the run box.

 3) Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_5834101f060b1.jpg)

 4) Under “Display adapters”, you’ll see more than one graphics card. Right-click on the integrated graphics card (usually an Intel or AMD graphics card). Click**Disable** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) Restart your PC.

 If you’re not sure which one is the integrated graphics one, disable one by one and see if the problem is resolved.

### Fix 5: Log in using a different user account

 The black screen problem can also be caused by corrupted Windows user profile. If you can log in to Windows with a different user account, and use it without any problems, a corrupted user profile may be the cause. You can then replace the folder of the corrupted user profile with the folder of the working user profile. Here’s how:

 1) [**Restart your computer in Safe Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2) Login with the working user account.

 3) Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\{working-user-profile-name}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Caches** .

 4) Copy the folder “Caches”.

 5) Login with the corrupted user account.

 6) Navigate to   **C:\\Users\\{broken-user-profile-name}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Caches** .

 7) Replace the folder with the folder from the working user file.

**If you don’t have an existing working user account** , you can create a new account. Here’s how:

 1) Ensure your Windows user account is an administrator. (If it’s not,  you can activate the built-in administrator account in Windows and use it to login to Windows. See the instructions further down this page for how to do this.)

 2) Type “settings” in the search box and select **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a65a17bf2fd8.png)

 3) Click**Accounts** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a65a2074051b.png)

 4) Click**Other people** in the left pane and click**Add someone else to this PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a65a33db93b2.jpg)

5) Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new user account.

6) Log in to this account and check to see if the black screen problem persists.

**Activate the built-in Windows administrator**

 If, as discussed above, your Windows account is not an administrator account, you can activate the built-in Windows administrator, then log in to that account to create a new user. Here’s how to activate the built-in Windows administrator:

 1) Open Command Prompt as administrator: type cmd in the search box. Right click**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a65a859df68c.png)

 2) Type **net user administrator /active:yes** and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a65a0d820104.png)

 3) Restart your computer and you’ll be able to log in to Windows with the administrator account.

 4) Create and test a new user account as described above.
