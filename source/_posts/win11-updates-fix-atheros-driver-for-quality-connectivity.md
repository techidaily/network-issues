## Fix 3: Update your Qualcomm adapter driver

 If you still can’t get onto the Internet, then chances are your Qualcomm adapter driver is corrupt, outdated, or not compatible with your operating system. To fix the problem, you should try to update your driver.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, but it may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) driver. And if you want Windows to download and install drivers automatically, you still need to have network connectivity, otherwise, it won’t work. You can also search for the most recent correct driver for your wireless adapter online, download it and install it step by step – but it’s rather time-consuming and error-prone. So if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually,**you can do it with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version.

 You can update drivers both online and offline. According to your actual situation, jump ahead to the section you’re interested in:
