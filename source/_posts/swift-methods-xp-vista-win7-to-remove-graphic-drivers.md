## Swift Methods: XP, Vista, Win7 to Remove Graphic Drivers

 A graphics (aka. video card, GPU, display) driver is a tiny program in your computer that enables the graphics card to communicate with the operating system. This way, the graphics card can better do its job in controlling how graphics (images, videos, apps, animation, 3D)  are displayed on the computer and improving them.

 Your screen won’t lose display after you uninstall the driver since Windows has its own basic built-in driver that takes the graphics rendering job from there. But the problem with the Windows basic driver is that you’re not getting the best out of your graphics card and you may also face poor screen resolution, blurry screen issues and crashes etc.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc** into the box and press **Enter** .

### Part 2: Install the latest graphics driver

 As mentioned above, it’s**ALWAYS** recommended to have the latest display driver installed for improved computer performance(better visual effects to say the very least, especially for gamers).

 There’re two ways you can update your device drivers —

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your device drivers manually by going to your GPU card’s manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose**ONLY** drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either [**Free**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer and enjoy!
