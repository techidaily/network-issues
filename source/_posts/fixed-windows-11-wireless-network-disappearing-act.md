## Fix 4: Reset the Winsock settings

**Winsock**  is a programming interface and supporting program in Windows operating system. It defines how Windows network software should access network services. If its data went wrong, this issue may occur.

 In this case, **r** **esetting Winsock data** may resolve this issue, because resetting Winsock data is helpful for dealing with some network connection issues. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key**   and **R**   at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd**   and press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Enter**   at the same time to **run**  **Command Prompt**  **as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes**  to run **Command Prompt** .
