## Resolved: Intermittent Backlit Beam in Device

 If your laptop screen keeps flickering, you may try the steps below in any order to troubleshoot the problems.

**1.** The problem may be caused by the outdated driver. Try to update the graphics card driver to your computer.

 If you’re a computer novice and have no idea how to update the driver, we recommend using [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

**2.** Change the refresh rate to match the capabilities of your monitor.

 Right-click the desktop and choose**Screen Resolution** , then click**Advanced Settings** and**Monitor** . If enabled, place a check beside**Hide Modes That This Monitor Cannot Display** and choose a**higher refresh rate** from the list trying at 80 Hertz if possible.

**3.** Magnetic field may make the monitor flicker.

 You can place your notebook in a wide-open area. Or you can take another computer to determine if the flicker is related to magnetic.

**4.** The problem can be related to virus, too. Please run Antivirus to kill virus in your laptop.

**5.** Hardware failure could be a cause. Since you have checked the screen cable work properly. The inverter and backlight can also cause this problem.
