### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 You can start troubleshooting the laptop screen flickering issue by ruling out the physical factors.

Here is how to do it:

 1) Check the laptop cables to see if there are any loose connections or faulty wires. You can first disconnect the cables from the connectors, then plug them back back and forth to see if the same problem occurs.

 2) Make sure to keep your HP laptop clear of any objects that could cause magnetic interference, such as speakers, cell phones, radios, other electrical devices.

### Fix 3: Change the screen refresh rate

 The screen refresh rate is the frequency with which the image on your laptop screen is refreshed. If it’s set on a wrong rate, it may cause the screen flickering or blinking problem. So you can check the current screen refresh rate, experiment with the possible rates to see if there is one more suitable to your screen.

Here is how to do it:

**[I’m using Windows 10](#W10) :**

**[I’m using Windows 7 or 8](#W78) :**

#### **I’m using Windows 10:**

 1) Right-click on **the empty area** of your desktop and click **Display settings** .

 2) In **Resolution** , click the drop-down menu and make sure **the recommended resolution** is selected.

 3) Check to see if your laptop screen flickering or blinking issue is resolved.

### Fix 4: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

2. Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC. Wait a few minutes, and it will give you a detailed report of your PC status.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
