## Fix 1: Close unnecessary programs

 The game lagging is generally a sign of a slow game. This can be caused by having too many high-power programs using your system resources. For the most optimal experience, it is recommended that when you run Roblox, you close those other programs. To do this, take these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and**X** at the same time to select**Task Manager** .

2. Select each resource-hogging application and click**End Task** to close them one by one.

 Try to launch Roblox again to see if it stops lagging now. If the problem remains, please move on.

## Fix 2: Delete temporary files

 Temporary files created by Windows or programs you use could take up some hard drive space, which slows down your computer. So to make your computer and the programs run smoother, you should delete those temp files. Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **%temp%** and then press **Enter** on your keyboard.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files.jpg)
3. Delete all the files in the **temp**  folder. (Press **Ctrl**  and **A** at the same time to select all the files. Then right-click and select **Delete** .)

## Fix 3: Update your network driver

 When your Roblox is lagging, it’s generally a sign of a slow connection. Your outdated network driver can be the culprit and make your game super laggy. To fix it, you need to update your network driver, especially if you can’t remember when you last updated it.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

## Fix 4: Use a wired connection

 For gaming purposes, a wired connection is preferable over a wireless connection. Wireless connections are most susceptible to interference and aren’t as consistent as wired connections. More importantly, they increase latency. Therefore, if possible, use a wired connection when you play a game online.

 However, if you don’t have access to the wired connection, don’t worry, you can check out other fixes below.

## Fix 5: Change your DNS settings

 Sometimes your ISP-supplied DNS server might be slow or not properly configured for caching, which can slow your connection a little bit. And that might be the reason that your Roblox is so laggy. To save you time troubleshooting, you’re supposed to change your DNS settings. Here we recommend the DNS addresses from Google:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**network icon** , then click**Open Network & Internet settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-network-settings.png)
2. Click**Change adapter options** .

5. Select**Use the following DNS server addresses** , fill in the Google DNS server addresses as below, then click**OK** .
