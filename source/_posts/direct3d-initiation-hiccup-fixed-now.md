 Direct3D, which belongs to a part of DirectX, is a**graphics application programming interface** for Windows, which is used to render**three-dimensional graphics** in applications or games like**Call of Duty** ,**Tomb Raider** , etc. Direct3D uses the hardware acceleration if it is available on the**graphics card** , and allows the hardware acceleration of the 3D rendering pipeline.

 Why does this problem happen? There are various reasons for this problem, and the possible causes can be the**old DirectX version** ,**the missing or outdated video drivers** , or**the missing DLL files** in your program file.

 You can**try the following solutions to fix it easily and quickly** !

### Fix 1: Check your DirectX version and update it

 As the error message suggested you can, first of all, check the DirectX version on**your computer** to see if it meets the minimum requirement (DirectX 9.0c and later). If it’s older than the required version, you’ll need to**update and install the latest DirectX** in your Windows.

#### **How to check the DirectX version in Windows?**

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)** **\+ R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 Graphics card driver issues can cause the**failed to initialize Direct3D** issue. If the video driver in your computer is missing or out of date, it can result in this problem and stop running the application or game. So you should **update the graphics card driver** to fix the error.

 There are two ways to update the graphics drivers: manually and automatically.

**Manually update driver** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, find the exact graphics card driver for your graphics adapter, and install it in your Windows.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way. You need to know for sure the right driver online that matches your Windows OS, download it, and install it step by step.

**Automatically update driver** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 With Driver Easy, you don’t have to search and find what drivers are needed in your PC, nor to update drivers step by step. It can considerably help with almost all the issues related to drivers.

 Furthermore, you can update your graphics card drivers automatically with either the FREE or Pro version of Driver Easy.**It only takes 2 simple clicks with the Pro version** (and you will get full support and**a 30-day money-back guarantee**).

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2)**Run** Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Then Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**the Update button** next to the driver name to download the correct driver (you can do that with the**FREE** version), then install it on your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the problem drivers (you can do that with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and you will be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

 4) After updating driver,**restart** your PC, and open your game/application to see if it works now.

 This should solve your problem. If the error still appears, don’t worry. There’s one more solution you can try.

### Fix 3: Reinstall Visual C++ Redistributables

 To fix**Failed to initialize Direct3D** error, you can also try to reinstall the Visual C++ Redistributables packages on your computer. It may lack the .dll files in the program files, so reinstalling the Visual C++ Redistributables can download the missing dll files to your computer, and the problem can be solved.

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)**
