## ```` ```` ``  Method 3: Update Display Driver

If the above method doesn’t work for you, you need to update your display card driver.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button.
