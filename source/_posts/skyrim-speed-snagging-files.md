## 1\. Check the server status

 To narrow down the source of the problem, the first thing you need to do is to check the [Epic Games status page](https://status.epicgames.com/) .

 If there are known server issues going on, they are usually visible on the page. If the problem is not from the server’s end, try the fixes below.

---

## 2\. Use a wired connection

 To download large files efficiently, a wired connection is preferable over a wireless connection to the internet. Wireless connections are most susceptible to interference and aren’t as consistent as wired connections. Therefore, if possible, use a wired connection.

 However, if you are not able to opt for a wired connection, check out the next fix below.

---

## 3\. Disconnect other devices

 The download issue is sometimes caused by your router struggling with the number of connections due to too many downloads happening simultaneously. To work around this, you need to first restart your router. Simply unplug your router or modem from its power outlet. Wait for 15-20 seconds, then plug it back in.

 If you have other devices connected to your Wi-Fi, disconnect them while you’re downloading games.

 When it’s all done, resume your download and check if it helps you fix the issue. If you’re still experiencing slow download speed or the download is stuck at a certain percent, proceed to the next fix.

---

## 4\. Update your network adapter driver

 If the previous steps didn’t work, it’s time to check if you’re using an outdated network adapter driver. An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. To fix it, you should update your drivers and your problem may be solved in no time.

##### How you can update your network adapter driver

## 5\. Switch Domain Name Systems (DNS)

Here we recommend using Google DNS:

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd** . Then click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/win11-cmd-Run-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click **Yes**  to continue.

3. In the command prompt window, type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-2.jpg)
4. Type **ipconfig /renew** and press **Enter** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cmd-3.jpg)
5. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control** and hit **Enter** .
