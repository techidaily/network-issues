## 1) Restart your device

## 2) Update or reinstall your touch screen driver

The problem of your touch screen may be caused by an old or incorrect touch screen driver.

But with the Pro version it takes only**2** clicks (and you get**full support**and a**30-day money back guarantee**):**a)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and Install**Driver Easy**.**b)** Run**Driver Easy**and hit the **Scan Now**button.**Driver Easy**will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 3) Reset operating system

If you are using**Windows 10**, you can check [**this guide**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to learn how to reset your operating system. If you are using a Windows system **other than Windows 10**, you can use a Windows installation media to reinstall your operating system.
