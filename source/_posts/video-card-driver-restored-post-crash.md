**Solution 3: Add Two Related Registry Keys**
  
 If neither of Solution 1 and Solution 2 doesn’t work for you, try adding two related registry keys to the this location:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/GraphicsDrivers.
  
 Before you get started, it is recommended that you back up the registry, so you can restore it if any problem occurs. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
  
 Follow these steps to add the registry keys:  
  
 1\. Press**Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog box will appear.  
  
 2\. Type**regedit** in the run box then click**OK** button. Then the “Registry” Editor will open.

4\. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

**Solution 4 : Take out the Graphics Card and Put it back in**

 Hope you can solve the problem with all solutions here.
