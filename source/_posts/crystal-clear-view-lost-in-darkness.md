2. [**Connect your laptop to an external monitor**](#b)
3. [**Have your laptop serviced**](#c)

### Fix 1: Re-enable your screen

 Your laptop screen may have accidentally been disabled. You should re-enable your laptop screen so you’re able to use it.

 To re-enable your laptop screen, try pressing**Fn** and**F1/F2/F4/…** (the function key that turns on/off your laptop screen) on your keyboard.

### Fix 2: Connect your laptop to an external monitor

 If your laptop screen is still not working, you should try connecting your laptop to a monitor. If the external monitor is working, then there are a few things you should try:

#### 1\. Update your device drivers

 Your laptop screen issue may be caused by wrong or outdated device drivers. To see if that’s the case for you, you should try updating your device drivers.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to_each device_ to download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all the drivers.
