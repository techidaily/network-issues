## 2\. Update Intel Graphics Card Driver (Recommended)

 You can do so via Windows Updates or Device Manager. Or you can search for the correct display driver on Intel support website by yourself.

## 3\. Clean Reinstall Intel Graphics Card Driver

 If updating your graphics card driver to the latest version fails to solve the problem for you, you need to perform a clean re-install of your Intel display card driver.

 1) Use Display Driver Uninstaller(DDU) or similar programs to do a clean uninstall of your current display driver. You should do the uninstall in Safe Mode.
