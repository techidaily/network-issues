## What is Graphics Card and why this problem happens

 A Graphics card is referred to**video card** ,**video adapter** , and**display adapter** as well. It **connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generates output images** to display. If you want to watch movies or play games on your computer, a dedicated graphics card can greatly improve the quality of the graphics.

 No Suitable Graphics Card Found error occurs usually because the developer changes the settings of the game, or your graphics card adapter is not suitable for the display anymore. So you can follow the solutions below to solve the issue.

### Fix 1: Restart your PC
