An Intel video card has been installed on the system and the driver is detecting the presence of that Third Party video card. That is to say, there are two video cards in your computer but you are using one of them (the Third Party video card). The Intel driver is trying to install for the Third Party video card. That’s why this error occurs. **Please follow these steps to alleviate this problem:** 1\. Open [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and run a scan. 2\.
