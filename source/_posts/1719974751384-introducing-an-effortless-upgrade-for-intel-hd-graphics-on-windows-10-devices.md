### **Method 1: Download and update the driver manually**

 Intel Graphics 3000 is not supported in Windows 10\.

Though you can’t find Intel Graphics 3000 Windows 10 driver on Intel’s website, the good news is you still can update Intel Graphics 3000 driver for your Windows 10.

 To download the latest Intel Graphics 3000 driver for Windows 7 or Windows 8, here’s what you need to do:

 1) Go to [Intel website](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81500/Intel-HD-Graphics-3000-for-2nd-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors) .

 2) Download the right driver according to the operating system that your PC is running (32-bit or 64-bit).
