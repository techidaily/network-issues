AMD Radeon R9 series of graphics card is one of the perfect choices for gamers. Windows 10 users have reported that they are having some problem with their AMD Radeon R9 series of graphics card.  
  
For example, some users reported that the screen would go blank after 5 to 20 minutes into the games and the only thing left to do was to restart. And that the screen flickered when they are playing games and the screen brightness could not be adjusted.
  
In such case, you might need to consider getting your graphics card driver checked and fix any problem it has by yourself.
  
In this post, we will show you exactly how to do it. So, just read along and follow the instructions to get your graphics card back to normal.
  
[**Step one: Run DISM command**](#1)
[**Step two: Run SFC command**](#2)
[**Step three: Clean install AMD Radeon R9 display driver**](#3)
  
Before we proceed with the following resolutions, please make sure that you have done the following things:
  
1) Check to see if you have installed the latest patches and fixes updates provided by Windows.In Windows, most patches and fixes are available through**Windows Update**.
