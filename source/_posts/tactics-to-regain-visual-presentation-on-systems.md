## Tactics to Regain Visual Presentation on Systems

![The laptop screen is black](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a30fc1dc5453-300x205.jpg)

You pressed the power button on your laptop to open it. You could hear your laptop fan spinning. And the indicator lights was flashing as usual. Then you were waiting for something popping up on your laptop screen. But after a while you found a horrible fact: there was nothing shown on the display — your laptop screen was black! There have been many laptop users seeing their laptop screen become black. In many cases, their laptop screen shows totally nothing, while for some the mouse cursor (only) is still visible. Common as it is, it is a quite frustrating issue — and quite scary. Your laptop doesn’t output anything on the screen, nor can it accepts any input (perhaps). You can’t use or access the data on your laptop. And you may not know how to fix it! But don’t worry. This issue CAN be fixed. The following are the methods that can help your get your laptop screen back to normal. They have helped many laptop users and they may be able to help you! Try these one at a time:

1. [**Restart the explorer.exe process**](#a)
2. [**Enter safe mode and undo recent changes**](#b)
3. [**Hard reset your laptop**](#c)
4. [**Reinstall your memory**](#d)
5. [**Have your laptop serviced**](#e)
 And there are also things you can do after troubleshooting if one of the methods above can help you:
1. [**Restore your system from a restore point**](#f)
2. [**Update your device drivers**](#g)

## Method 1: Restart the explorer.exe process

You may get the black screen issue because the explorer.exe process on your computer has been closed (possibly by a virus). It is a process that manages the desktop, taskbar, etc, on your operating system. Closing it can make your desktop and taskbar invisible, and you get the black screen issue. To fix this issue, you can check and restart the process manually. To do so:**1)**Press the**Ctrl**,**Shift**and**Esc**key on your keyboard at the same time. This will open Task Manager.**2)**Click the**Details**tab (or the**Processes**tab in Windows 7’s Task Manager) and see if there exists a process called “**explorer.exe**”

 “Explorer.exe” in Windows 7’s Task Manager

If there is, try ending the process (right-clicking it and selecting **End task**or**End process**) and then reboot your computer. Then check to see if this fixes your problem. But if you can’t see the explorer process, you can run it on your own:**i.** Click**File**and click**Run new task**.

**ii.**In the Create new task dialog that pops up, type “_**explorer.exe**_” and press**Enter**on your keyboard.

**iii.**The process will run and you can see if your desktop becomes normal.**3)** If the steps above bring your desktop back, you may need to _ [**restore your system to a previous state**](#f) _ in order to prevent your issue occurring again.

## Method 2: Enter safe mode and undo recent changes

You may have change some settings or installed a program on your computer, which are incompatible with your operating system. And it causes the black screen problem of your laptop. You can try going into safe mode of your system and undo these changes. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode of your operating system. You can use it to troubleshoot issues on your computer. The method of entering safe mode varies depending on the Windows version you are using. You can check [**this guide**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to learn how to do this. When you are in safe mode, undo the recent changes you have made to the**system settings**. Or uninstall the**program**you have recently installed on your program. If you have**updated your system**right before you got the black screen issue, uninstalled these updates and contact Microsoft for advice. If you are not clear what you have changed, it is recommended that you use [**System Restore**](#f) feature to revert your computer’s state.

## Method 3: Hard reset your laptop

Hard resetting your laptop can clear all the information in your memory and the charges in your laptop. This is helpful for restoring your laptop screen. To hard reset your laptop:**1)**Turn off your laptop.**2)** Disconnect all the**peripheral devices**on your laptop.**3)**Remove the**battery**. (If it is not removable, skip this step.)**4)** Disconnect the power cable from your laptop.**5)** Press and hold the**power button**on your laptop for about**one**minute.**6)** Connect the**power cable**to your laptop and turn it on.**7)**Turn off your laptop.**8)** Connect the**battery**to your laptop and turn it on.**9)** If this method works for you, you will see there starts to be something showing up on your laptop screen. _Note that this method may not be able to hard reset laptops of all makes. You can consult the official guides for your laptop for the proper way of hard resetting your device._

## Method 4: Reinstall your memory

It is also possible that your laptop screen issue comes from your laptop memory (RAM).

 Laptop memory

It has gone wrong and stops your laptop from completing the self test. You can try reinstalling your laptop memory and see if this can fix your screen issue. To do so:**1)** Turn off your laptop and disconnect the**power cable**and the**battery**from your device.**2)**Remove the**cover**on the**memory module compartment**on the back of your laptop. (You may need to check the manual or the official guides of your product for instructions on how to do this.)**3)** Remove the**memory**from your laptop.**4)**Rub the**golden contact**of your memory with an**eraser**. (This can clean the golden contact of your memory.)**5)** Install the**memory**back to your laptop.**6)**Place the**memory module compartment cover**back to your laptop.**7)**Turn on your laptop and see if your issue is fixed.

## Method 5: Have your laptop serviced

If none of the methods above could help you, your issue may be a hardware problem that you can’t solve yourself. You may need to ask a computer expert to help you. If your laptop is still under warranty, you can contact the manufacturer of your device. They can check your laptop and get it repaired or replaced.
