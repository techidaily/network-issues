 Users with NVIDIA GTX 950 graphics card installed on their computer reported to have found that they see a yellow exclamation mark next to their display driver. when checking the properties of the video card driver, the following error notification appears:

 **Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)** 

 The combination of GTX 950 and Windows 10 is not uncommon when it comes to Code 43 with NVIDIA. But no need to worry so much about it, there are ways to get it fixed. 

[**Option 1: Clean re-install NVIDIA 950**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) 

[**Option 2: Update Windows 10**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) 

[**Option 3: Update BIOS**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) 

[**Option 4: Reinstall Windows 10**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) 

 Before we move on to the fixes, there are something that you need to know about the causes of Code 43: 

**a** . it could be that Windows does not recognize your graphics card. So you need to make sure that your graphics card is correctly installed; 

**b** . code 43, in most cases, means that certain device driver is missing, corrupted, and/or outdated; 

**c** . Windows cannot recognize faulty hardware either, so please make sure that your display card is in good conditions. 

##  Option 1: Clean re-install NVIDIA 950

 To perform a clean re-install of your graphics card driver, you may need some help from tools like CCleaner or Display Driver Uninstaller. In this post, we choose**Display Driver Uninstaller** .

 3) If new updates are available, just download and then update them as instructed. 

 4) Restart your computer after the update. Then check to see if the code 43 still remains. 

## **Option 3: Update BIOS**

 Updating BIOS is said to solve the problem for many, but it requires you to master a rather high level of computer knowledge to update BIOS by yourself. 

 So if you are not exactly a tech savvy, we suggested that you go to the manufacturer support website and get all the support available before you move on to update your BIOS. 

**Warning** : Please do make sure that you are fully aware of what you are to do before you choose to update your BIOS. Unrecoverable errors are the last thing we want to see. 

 After you make the decision of updating your BIOS, go to the manufacturer website of your PC and see if the latest version of BIOS is available to download. Then follow the instructions to get your BIOS updated.
