## Remedying Screen Malfunctions in Laptops

![The laptop screen is black](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a30fc1dc5453-300x205.jpg)

You pressed the power button on your laptop to open it. You could hear your laptop fan spinning. And the indicator lights was flashing as usual. Then you were waiting for something popping up on your laptop screen. But after a while you found a horrible fact: there was nothing shown on the display — your laptop screen was black! There have been many laptop users seeing their laptop screen become black. In many cases, their laptop screen shows totally nothing, while for some the mouse cursor (only) is still visible. Common as it is, it is a quite frustrating issue — and quite scary. Your laptop doesn’t output anything on the screen, nor can it accepts any input (perhaps). You can’t use or access the data on your laptop. And you may not know how to fix it! But don’t worry. This issue CAN be fixed. The following are the methods that can help your get your laptop screen back to normal. They have helped many laptop users and they may be able to help you! Try these one at a time:

1. [**Restart the explorer.exe process**](#a)
2. [**Enter safe mode and undo recent changes**](#b)
3. [**Hard reset your laptop**](#c)
4. [**Reinstall your memory**](#d)
5. [**Have your laptop serviced**](#e)
 And there are also things you can do after troubleshooting if one of the methods above can help you:
1. [**Restore your system from a restore point**](#f)
2. [**Update your device drivers**](#g)

## Method 1: Restart the explorer.exe process

You may get the black screen issue because the explorer.exe process on your computer has been closed (possibly by a virus). It is a process that manages the desktop, taskbar, etc, on your operating system. Closing it can make your desktop and taskbar invisible, and you get the black screen issue. To fix this issue, you can check and restart the process manually. To do so:**1)**Press the**Ctrl**,**Shift**and**Esc**key on your keyboard at the same time. This will open Task Manager.**2)**Click the**Details**tab (or the**Processes**tab in Windows 7’s Task Manager) and see if there exists a process called “**explorer.exe**”

When you are in safe mode, undo the recent changes you have made to the**system settings**. Or uninstall the**program**you have recently installed on your program. If you have**updated your system**right before you got the black screen issue, uninstalled these updates and contact Microsoft for advice. If you are not clear what you have changed, it is recommended that you use [**System Restore**](#f) feature to revert your computer’s state.

## Method 3: Hard reset your laptop

Hard resetting your laptop can clear all the information in your memory and the charges in your laptop. This is helpful for restoring your laptop screen.
