## Fix 3: Update the driver for your wireless network adapter

 A missing or corrupted driver may be the root of this issue.   **Try updating the driver for your wireless network adapter**  to see if you can resolve it.

 There are two ways to update the driver for your wireless network adapter: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Manually update the driver for your wireless network adapter**   – You can update it manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s   **compatible with your exact wireless network adapter model and your version of Windows** .

**Or**

 **Update the driver for your wireless network adapter automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## Fix 4: Reset the Winsock settings

**Winsock**  is a programming interface and supporting program in Windows operating system. It defines how Windows network software should access network services. If its data went wrong, this issue may occur.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key**   and **R**   at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd**   and press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Enter**   at the same time to **run**  **Command Prompt**  **as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes**  to run **Command Prompt** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Snap602.png)
2. In the Command Prompt, type **netsh winsock reset** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Snap603.png)
3. **Restart**  your PC to complete the reset.

See if your wireless network adapter appears in Device Managers.

## Fix 5: Replace your network interface controller card

 If your wireless network adapter doesn’t appear in Device Manager after you tried all the fixes above, it’s time to consult the manufacturer of your PC for further support, since the worst case of this issue could be the problem of your**NIC (network interface controller) card** .

 Hopefully one of the fixes above resolved this issue for you. Feel free to leave us a comment if you have any questions or suggestion.
