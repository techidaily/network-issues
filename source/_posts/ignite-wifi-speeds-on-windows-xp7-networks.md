## Fix 1: Disable Peer to Peer Update

**Peer to Peer Update** is a feature in Windows that allows your computer to share Windows updates peer-to-peer with other computers over the Internet, which can compromise our Internet connection, hence the sluggish Internet issue.

 To disable**Peer to Peer Update** :

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type**control update** in the box and press**Enter** .

## Fix 2: Adjust the Internet Bandwidth Settings

 Please note that Group Policy Editor is not supported on Windows 10/11 Home Edition. So if you’re not using Windows Pro, or Enterprise, please move on to [Fix3](#F3) .

 By default, Windows reserves 20% of your bandwidth for Windows Update, system apps, and other purposes, leaving you with 80% bandwidth of Internet connection. If you don’t use Windows Update on a daily basis and the reservation limit slows your Internet down, then you can remove the limit by setting the value to 0.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift,** and**Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager.
2. Click**Run new task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/taskmanagernewtask.jpg)
3. Copy & paste **gpedit.msc** into the box, tick the box before **Create this task with administrative privileges** , and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b67c73fda271.png)
4. Under **Computer Configuration** , double-click on**Administrative Templates** \>**Network** \>**QoS Packet Scheduler** . Then double-click on **Limit reservable bandwidth** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7121e2c956c.jpg)
5. Click the**Enabled** option and set**Bandwidth limit (%)** value to**0** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

5. Hopefully, your **Windows 10/11 Slow Internet** issue has been resolved successfully.

## Some other modifications

 If none of the above network-related changes prove effective, here are some other tweaks that you can do to improve your network connectivity situation, and thus help to improve the network speed on your computer. Check the following to see if you’ve done them all:

* **Reduce the number of devices connected to the same router** to make sure that your main computer gets the most speed.
* **Use a wired network connection** (with an Ethernet cable) instead of Wi-Fi. If this is not an option, move your computer closer to the router.
* **Update your router firmware** if you haven’t already.
* In your router settings, try to **enable QoS to prioritize gaming traffic** . If you’re not sure where to find it, please visit your router’s official website to find the manual or seek help from your ISP.
* **Contact your ISP** . If you’ve tried everything and your internet is still slow, it might be an issue with your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Contact them for support.
* **Upgrade Your Plan** : If your internet plan is outdated or doesn’t provide enough bandwidth for your needs, consider upgrading to a plan with higher speeds.
* **Upgrade your hardware** . If the network settings are set up all correctly, but the network speed is still slow, it’s possible that your hardware is throttling the network speed. In that case, you may need to consider a more advanced router or modem, network cables and network adapters.
