## AMD Graphics Support Achieved Post-Fix

 If you receive an error message that says, “ **Your video adapter does not have the 3D Acceleration option**  “, or “ **Your video adapter does not meet the game requirements**  .”

 It may be because:

* **Direct3D Acceleration is disabled;**
* **The latest version of DirectX is not installed or is damaged;**
* **Your graphics card driver is outdated or missing;**
* **Your computer doesn’t meet the minimum 3D hardware requirements to run the application.**

## ****How to fix Direct3D Acceleration not available**

 **Solution 1:[Verify your Direct3D is enabled and DirectX version is up to date](#method1)**

 **Solution 2: [Update your graphics card driver](#method2)**

 **Solution 3: [Reinstall Visual C++ Redistributables](#method3)**

**Direct3D** , as part of DirectX, is a graphics application programming interface (API) for Windows. It’s used to render three-dimensional objects in applicatioins, including games, and allows them to be run in full-screen mode.

### Solution 1: Verify your Direct3D is enabled and DirectX version is up to date

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7b8ac86a6f5.png)**  and  
 **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type****dxdiag**and click****OK** .

3. In DirectX Diagnostic Tool, click on the****Display**tab to check if your Direct3D Acceleration is****enabled** . If not, click to enable it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7b8c1f7496a.jpg)
4. Click on the**System** tab to check your**DirectX Version** .  If it doesn’t meet the requirement (DirectX 9.0 and later), you should update your DirectX version in your system. Updating DirectX varies from Windows versions.  
 If you’re using Windows 10, 8 or 8.1, you’ll need to update and install the latest DirectX; if you’re using Windows 7, Vista or XP, you should install a service pack to update. Check the Microsoft support to update DirectX in different Windows system: [How to install the latest version of DirectX](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx)  .

### Solution 2: Update your graphics card driver

 A missing or outdated graphics card driver may also cause your**Direct3D Not Available** problem. You should update your graphics card driver to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics card driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics card driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click ****Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update**  next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All**  . You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

1. Press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7b8ac86a6f5.png)**  +  
 **R** key  
 to open the Run box.
