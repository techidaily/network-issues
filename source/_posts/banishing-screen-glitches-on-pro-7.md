## Banishing Screen Glitches on Pro 7

 Many Surface laptop users are reporting that they get Surface Pro 7 flickering screens quite often. This might become a recurring problem. If you’re experiencing the same issue, don’t worry. In this post, you’ll learn every possible way to keep your Surface Pro working again.

## About the screen flickering

 According to [Windows Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-screen-flickering-in-windows-10-f96b545d-a34c-40da-9115-378f78fbbbbf) and [their official troubleshooting guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-screen-flickering-in-windows-10-47d5b0a7-89ea-1321-ec47-dc262675fc7b) , screen flickering in Windows 10 is usually caused by a display driver issue or an incompatible app.

 But there’s more to that. Your Surface Pro 7 screen flickering can also be caused by corrupt system files, out-of-date BIOS, or hardware faults.

## Try these fixes

 No matter what caused your Surface Pro 7 to screen flicker, you can try the following troubleshooting to fix the issue. You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable adaptive brightness](#h1)**
2. **[Update your display drivers](#h2)**
3. **[Close unnecessary apps](#h3)**
4. **[Change the refresh rate](#h4)**
5. **[Run the System File Checker](#h5)**

### Fix 1: Disable adaptive brightness

 This is the first thing you should try because it’s simple and effective. Many users find turning off**Change brightness automatically when lighting changes** helps them solve the flickering issue.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) Go to**Start Menu** and select**Settings** from the left edge of the start menu.

 2) Select the**System** section.

 3) Go to the**Display** tab.

 4) Uncheck the**Change** **brightness automatically when lighting changes** option.

 Alternatively, you download the**Internet Graphic Command Center** app from Microsoft Store. Once in the app, select **System** from the left menu, then select **Power** from the top menu, and switch off**Adaptive Brightness** of**On Battery** and on**Plugged In** .

 You’ll find the Surface Pro 7 screen flickering stops right away. But if not, don’t worry. You should be able to fix it by following these fixes below.

### Fix 2: Update your display drivers

 Your Surface Pro 7 screen may flicker or blink frequently if you’re using the wrong or outdated device drivers, especially the display drivers. Therefore, you should update these drivers to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the correct drivers for your graphics card: manually or automatically.

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official **[driver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100419)** [**download page**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100419) , and select **Download** this file. You may need to choose the appropriate .msi file. Then click**Next** \>**Save As** and choose your desktop as the save location. Run this MSI file and follow the instructions to install the graphics driver.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-6.png)

 The MSI file allows you to selectively install or deploy individual drivers, or the MSI will install all relevant drivers automatically.

**Automatically (recommended) –** If you are not familiar with installing drivers, and if you don’t have the time to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It’s a useful tool that automatically recognizes your system and finds the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how you can update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 3: Close unnecessary apps

 I know sometimes we prefer to run all of our favorite applications and programs in the background. In certain cases, your Surface Pro 7 can’t handle the parameters and specs of some applications which can cause screen flickering.

 In order to figure out if an incompatible app is responsible for your Surface Pro 7 screen flickering, here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**CTRL + ALT + DEL** at the same time to open Task Manager.

 2) Watch your screen carefully for any flickering. If everything on the screen flickering except the Task Manager, then you’ve got an incompatible app on your Surface Pro 7.

 3) But if the Task Manager flickers too, then you can be sure that there are no issues with your applications.

 If there’s a problem with one of your favorite applications, you can try [**performing a clean boot**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows-da2f9573-6eec-00ad-2f8a-a97a1807f3dd) .

### Fix 4: Change the refresh rate

 The refresh rate of your Surface Pro 7’s display can cause some input lag, therefore you can notice some screen flickering. To fix it, here’s what you need to do:

 1) Right-click on the**Start Men** u of your desktop screen and click **Display settings** .

 Now check if the screen of your Surface Pro 7 stops flickering. If the flickering persists, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Run the System File Checker

 Missing or damaged system files may lead to your Surface Pro 7 screen flickering. Some users find repairing the systems files helped them solve the issue.

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Surface Pro 7 screen flickering. It will deal with issues related to system errors, critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* **[Option 2 – Manually](#sfc)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.
