## Graphics Performance Restored

Many NVIDIA graphics card users have reported that their GeForce Experience has failed to work — It can’t be opened, or an error pops up when they open it. If you are in the same situation, not to worry. It is possible to fix this problem. Here are two fixes you can try: Method 1:[**Reinstall GeForce Experience**](#a) Method 2:[**Update your graphics driver**](#b)

## Method 1: Reinstall GeForce Experience

Reinstalling GeForce Experience can fix the corruption issues in the GeForce Experience application:**1)**Uninstall GeForce Experience**2)** Go to the [**GeForce Experience download website**](https://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download) to download the latest version of the program.**3)** Install the program on your computer. Then check to see if you can open it this time.

## Method 2: Update your graphics driver

The problem may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it is out of date. You can try reinstalling your graphics driver and see if this resolves the problem. If you are not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).**Driver Easy**will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or**Pro**version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only**2** clicks (and you get**full support**and a**30-day money back guarantee**):**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and Install**Driver Easy**.**2)** Run**Driver Easy**and hit the **Scan Now**button.**Driver Easy**will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a3cbf61b437.jpg) **3)** Click on the**Update**button next to the graphics card to download the latest and correct driver for it.
