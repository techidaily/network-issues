 But don’t worry. It is possible to fix this error. You can try the methods below:

 Method 1:[**Update your graphics driver**](#a)
 Method 2: **[Contact the manufacturer of your graphics adapter](#b)**
  
## Method 1: Update your graphics driver

## Method 2: Contact the manufacturer of your graphics adapter
