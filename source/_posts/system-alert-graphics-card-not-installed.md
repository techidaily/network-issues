## What is Graphics Card and why this problem happens

 A Graphics card is referred to**video card** ,**video adapter** , and**display adapter** as well. It **connects to the motherboard of a computer system and generates output images** to display. If you want to watch movies or play games on your computer, a dedicated graphics card can greatly improve the quality of the graphics.

 No Suitable Graphics Card Found error occurs usually because the developer changes the settings of the game, or your graphics card adapter is not suitable for the display anymore. So you can follow the solutions below to solve the issue.

### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Restarting your PC helps your PC to check through the system and automatically update your Windows, then the problem may be automatically resolved.

 1)**Restart** your PC.

 2) After restarting,**open** the game again and see if the problem is resolved.

 If the problem persists, please try the following solutions until you find the way that works.

**Note** : All the screen shots below are shown on Windows 10, but the fixes also apply to Windows 7 & 8.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 This problem may occur due to the missing or outdated drivers of your graphics card. So updating the drivers can probably fix this problem.

 There are two ways you can update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

 Manual driver update – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step .

### Fix 3: Delete the config.dat file of your game

 The Config.dat file is created by the game manufacturer that primarily stores settings that are chosen via the game’s settings menu. Generally speaking, the Config.dat file resides here: Documents\\My Games\\the name of your game (like Terraria).

 1) Go to**Documents**  \>**My Games** .

2) Click the file named after your game (like Terraria)

 3) Right click the**config.dat** file, click**delete** , and click**Yes** . (Please don’t worry. This will not affect your game. And it will download the Config.dat file again when you play it.)
