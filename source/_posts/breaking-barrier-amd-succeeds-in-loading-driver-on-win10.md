 Actually, this is not a difficult question to solve. Basically, if you want to install AMD Catalyst drivers, you need to uninstall the drivers installed by Microsoft first which was installed when you set up your system. Please follow the instructions below to get the problem fixed in no time.
  
 1) First, download**AMD Catalyst Install Manager** from the official website of AMD if you have not done it yet.
  
 2) Make sure that your computer is fully updated from**Windows Update** (in**Start** button**\> Settings > Update & Security**). Please pay extra attention to the C++ and [**.NetFrameworks**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) upgrades.

 You may want to restart your computer when the uninstall finishes.
  
 5) Now we are moving on to update your drivers manually. Go to **[support website of AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)**  and search for the correct graphics driver for your system. If you are not sure what driver you need, you can choose the option on the left so the automatic detect will help you locate the exact driver.
