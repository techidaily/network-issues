**Solution 3: Add Two Related Registry Keys**
  
 If neither of Solution 1 and Solution 2 doesn’t work for you, try adding two related registry keys to the this location:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/GraphicsDrivers.
  
 Before you get started, it is recommended that you back up the registry, so you can restore it if any problem occurs. See [How to Back Up and Restore Registry](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
  
 Follow these steps to add the registry keys:  
  
 1\. Press**Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog box will appear.  
  
 2\. Type**regedit** in the run box then click**OK** button. Then the “Registry” Editor will open.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_56d15158994b0.png)

  4\. On the**Edit** menu in the right pane, right-click on the blank place. Click**New** , and then select the following registry value from the drop-down menu specific to your version of Windows.

 If your PC is running**32-bit** operating system, follow these steps:

  b. Type**TdrDelay** as the**Name** and click**Enter** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_56d15185e69a6.png)

 c. Double-click TdrDelay and add “20” for the Value data and click**OK** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58fdcefb5f556.png)

 Repeat steps above to add a new DWORD named “**TdrDdiDelay** ” and also add “20” for the Value data.  
  
 If your PC is running**64-bit** operating system, follow steps below:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_56d151bc4d971.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/img_56d151caa9437.png)

  c. Double-click TdrDelay and add “20” for the Value data and click**OK** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58fdd06cb443f.png)

 Repeat steps above to add a new DWORD named “ **TdrDdiDelay** ” and also add  “20” for the Value data.  
  
4\. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

**Solution 4 : Take out the Graphics Card and Put it back in**
  
 If the graphics card is not seated well in the PCI-E slot, the problem may occur. So take out the graphics card and put it back in the slot. It is recommended that you use a soft cloth to clean the slot before you put it back in.  
  
 Hope you can solve the problem with all solutions here.  
  
 If you are not comfortable with some of these solutions, you can take your computer to the repair store to have it checked.
