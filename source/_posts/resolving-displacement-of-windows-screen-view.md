### Fix 1: Restore your screen rotation with a keyboard shortcut

This is the simplest way to fix your screen issue: Hold down the**Ctrl**and**Alt**keys on your keyboard, then press the**up arrow key**. This should change your screen orientation back to the normal one. If this didn’t work for you, you may need to try changing your screen rotation in your display settings.

### Fix 2: Restore your screen rotation in your display settings

To change your screen rotation in your system display settings:

1. Right click an empty area of your desktop, then select**Screen resolution** .

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

You may have a screen upside down issue even if you didn’t do anything wrong. This is because your graphics driver is not working properly. You should try updating your graphics driver to see if this resolves your problem.

You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to_your graphics adapter_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install the driver. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
