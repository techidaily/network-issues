## Network Hiccups Persistently

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no-network-connection.png)

 **If your WiFi connection keeps dropping out, then reconnecting, you’re not alone** . Many Windows users are reporting this problem. It’s frustrating, but don’t worry – it’s usually possible to fix the issue.

 Here are**three** steps you can try to get your WiFi connection stable again. Just work your way through the list until your problem is resolved.

1. **[Some quick checks](#check)**
2. **[Change the power management setting](#s1)**
3. **[Reset the Wi-Fi AutoConfig service](#s2)**
4. **[Update network adapter driver](#s3)**

 If your Windows 10/11 computer isn’t the only device with this problem (say, the same thing happens to your cell phone and your Mac), it’s very likely that your router is at fault, not your computer or network connection.

## Some quick checks

 When your Wi-Fi disconnects and connects frequently, here are some quick checkups that you can do with your router and computer to see if they help:

1. Restart your computer that’s having trouble staying online.
2. Disable any proxy or VPN services if you have any running in the background, as they may interfere with the network connection.
3. Move your computer closer to your router or modem.
4. Power cycle your router and modem by unplugging them, waiting 30 seconds, then plugging them back in.
5. Make sure your router firmware is up to date.

## Step 1: Change the power management

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and the**R key** to open the Run command window.
2. Type in**control** in the box and hit**Enter** .

## Step 3: Update network adapter driver

 If the steps above don’t fix your problem, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong or corrupted network driver. To resolve this issue, **you should try updating the wireless network adapter driver to the latest version** .

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your wireless network adapter: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your network adapter driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for it, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your wireless network adapter drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact video card and monitor, and your variant of Windows, and it will download and install them correctly. Simply follow these steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)
