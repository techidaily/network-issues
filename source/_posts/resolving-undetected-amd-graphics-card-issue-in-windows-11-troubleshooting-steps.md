###  Solution 1: Update the AMD graphics driver

 There are two ways to update your AMD graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** — You can update your AMD graphics driver manually by going to the AMD website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact graphics card model and your version of Windows.

**Automatic driver update** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your AMD graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to your AMD graphics card to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).
