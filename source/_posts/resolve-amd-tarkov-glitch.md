 This may take some minutes to redownload and reinstall any missing or corrupted game files.

 When the process is finished, relaunch your game and test the gameplay. If it’s still unplayable when it’s raining, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Delete the game cache

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

 Then relaunch your game. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Clean your temp folder

 Apart from clearing the game cache, you may want to clean the temp folder which stores temporary game files. This won’t cause any issues and instead, you’ll receive a performance boost.

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .
