### Fix 1: Change your screen resolution

 There’s a good chance your graphics hardwares have been fighting among each other on which resolution to output, hence the**Unable to save display settings** error. If this is the case, you should make sure your screen resolution is set to**the lowest one** .

 So for example, if you have 3 monitors of resolutions, namely 1900 x 1200, 1600 x 900, 1280 x 800, then you should make sure you set the screen resolution to 1280 x 800 in order for a successful setup.

To do so:

1. Right-click on**any empty space** on your desktop and click**Screen resolution** .

2. In the**Resolution** section, click**the drop-down menu** and select**the lowest resolution of all the connected monitors** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

3. Restart your computer and check if the **Unable to save display settings** issue has been fixed. If no, then move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 This**Unable to save display settings** error may occur if you are using the wrong  graphics  driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics driver  to see if it fixes your problem.
