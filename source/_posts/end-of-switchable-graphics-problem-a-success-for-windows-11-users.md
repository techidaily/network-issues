## What does switchable graphics mean?

 The switchable graphics feature allows you to switch between using the Intel® graphics and a discrete graphics controller in a computer. For example, you can switch between the enhanced battery life of the Intel graphics while running on laptop battery power and the performance capabilities of the discrete graphics controller while the laptop is plugged into AC power. You can check on the manufacturer website of your laptop to see whether your computer and your operating system support switchable graphics.

## 2: Update graphics drivers

 One of the biggest reasons for your not working well graphics cards is outdated, missing or faulty drivers. The solution to this is quite easy, though: just update your graphics card driver to the most recent correct version would do the magic.

There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your video cards: manually or automatically:

**Manual driver update** –  You can update your video cards drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer and searching for the most recent correct driver for each. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10\.

**Automatic driver update**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact video card and monitor, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged video driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
