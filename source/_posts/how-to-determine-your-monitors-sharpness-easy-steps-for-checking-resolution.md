###  2\. How can I prevent my PC from having display issues

 Display issues like blurry/flickering screen, distortion, black/blue screen of death are most likely to happen when you have the outdated/corrupted/mismatched graphics drivers in your computer. So itâ€™s always recommended to have the latest graphics drivers (and possibly others) installed to nip these problems in the bud and save us from trips hauling our computer down a computer repair shop.

 Thereâ€™re two ways you can update your device drivers â€” manually or automatically:

**Update your drivers manually** â€“ You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturerâ€™s official website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose **ONLY**  drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions. Then download & update them all by yourself.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. 

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)
3. You can upgrade to [**the Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b594e371b13c.jpg) You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.
