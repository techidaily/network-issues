## Fix 3: Update the driver for your wireless network adapter

**Manually update the driver for your wireless network adapter**   – You can update it manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s   **compatible with your exact wireless network adapter model and your version of Windows** .

**Or**

 **Update the driver for your wireless network adapter automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

3. **Restart**  your PC to complete the reset.

See if your wireless network adapter appears in Device Managers.

## Fix 5: Replace your network interface controller card

 If your wireless network adapter doesn’t appear in Device Manager after you tried all the fixes above, it’s time to consult the manufacturer of your PC for further support, since the worst case of this issue could be the problem of your**NIC (network interface controller) card** .
