## 2\. Delete the game cache

 Another great way to troubleshoot your issue is by clearing the cache. Temporary files and data are often stored. But over time, this cached data might become corrupted, which can lead to issues with connectivity, game freezes, slow or unsuccessful game loads, and other performance issues. In this situation, you’ll need to clear the cache from the EST launcher. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

## 3\. Clean your temp folder

 Apart from clearing the game cache, you may want to clean the temp folder which stores temporary game files. This won’t cause any issues and instead, you’ll receive a performance boost.

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .

 When it’s done, relaunch your game. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.
