### Fix 1: Restart and reconnect your devices

 It’s likely your problem is caused by the hardware connection. So you should make sure that the hardware components (including the HDMI ports and cables) are working properly, then reconnect.

1. Disconnect all your**HDMI** **cables** from your ports.
2. Shut down all your**devices** (your computer, monitor, and TV) completely and unplug their**power** **cables** (and battery if you are using a laptop).
3. Leave them for five minutes.
4. Plug the**power** **cables** (and the battery) back in.
5. Connect the**HDMI** **cables** back to your devices.
6. Power on the devices.

Now check and see if your laptop to TV by HDMI works.

### Fix 2: Configure your Display Settings

 When HDMI from your laptop to TV doesn’t work, one of the possible reasons is the incorrect display settings on your laptop. So it’s always a good idea to check your laptop’s display settings:

 To check your computer display settings, press the**Windows logo key** and**P** on your keyboard at the same time. A list of display modes will appear.

The difference between each mode is as follows:

* **PC screen/Computer only** — Using only the first monitor.
* **Duplicate** — Displaying the same content on both monitors.
* **Extend** — Using both monitors to display an extended desktop.
* **Second screen/Projector only** — using only the second monitor.

### Fix 3: Update available drivers

 A missing or outdated device driver in your laptop can stop HDMI from your laptop to TV from working, especially your graphics card driver and USB driver. To rule it out as the cause for your problem, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website, find your hardware device driver and download the latest version. Then manually install it in your computer. Be sure to download the one that is compatible with your Windows OS. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version. But with the Pro version it takes only 2 clicks (and you’ll get full support and**30-day money back guarantee**):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it on your computer.  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

4. Restart your computer to take effect.
