 If you’re on Windows and you’re seeing the message saying_**NvStreamUserAgent.exe – Application Error**_ after you restart or wake your PC from sleep mode, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. Even though it doesn’t do harm to your computer, not getting this message to go away is annoying enough. 

 No worries, it’s not a hard problem to fix. Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you. 

 **Method 1:[Reinstall NVIDIA Display Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 
 **Method 2:[Update NVIDIA Display Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** 
 **Method 3:[Disable NVIDIA Streamer Service](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**Note:** The screens shot below are shown on Windows 10, but all fixes apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8 as well. 

##  1\. Reinstall NVIDIA Display Driver
