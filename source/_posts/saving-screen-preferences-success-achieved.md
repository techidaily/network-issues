## **Fix TWO: Update your display driver**

```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ````

######

```` ``

```` ```` ```` `` Some errors occur after upgrading to Windows 10 mostly due to not compatible drivers. The display settings could not be saved error could also due to incorrect display drivers. Thus make sure to update your display drivers.

```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ````

```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` To update your display drivers, you can download the latest one from your monitor manufacturer’s website. Like many game users may use NVIDIA graphic card, so if you also use one, go to its downloads center   **☞ [NVIDIA Download](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)** [](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) .

```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ````

```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` ```` But such way asks you to find the correct driver for your device first and download all by yourself. Thus it’s not convenient and really time-consuming.
