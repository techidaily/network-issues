## Seamless Wi-Fi Integration Guide: From Hardware to OS Compatibility

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdc325d557dc.jpg)

 WiFi is everywhere. However, a missing or outdated WiFi adapter driver may stop your computer from connecting to WiFi. So you should always keep your WiFi adapter driver up-to-date.

There are two ways you can update your WiFi adapter driver:

[**Option 1 — Manually**](#o1) — You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your WiFi adapter driver this way because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)**](#o2) — This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks — easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1: Download and install the driver manually

 You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your WiFi adapter. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

If you don’t know what Wi-Fi adapter you have, take these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** to open the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** and hit Enter.

3. Type or paste**`netsh wlan show drivers`** . Then hit Enter. Now you should be able to see your Wi-Fi adapter type.
