###  Fix 4 – Reboot modem

1. **Disconnect** the modem from your device.
2. **Wait several minutes** for all the lights off.
3. **Plug in** the modem back and wait until all the lights indicating connectivity are on.
4. Try to**launch Zoom** again and check if the connection error message still appears.

Hope this trick works for you. If not, continue to the next solution.

###  Fix 5 – Restart router

 Another device playing a vital role in network connection is the router. A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. To fix Zoom’s unstable connection, restarting the router is also a useful solution.

1. **Unplug** the router.
2. **Wait several minutes** for a fully offline status of the router.
3. **Plug in** the router and wait at least 2 minutes to let it boot up.
4. **Test Zoom** to see if the problem remains after regaining the connection.
