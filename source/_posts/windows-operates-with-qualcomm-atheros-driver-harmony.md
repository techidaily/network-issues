 When your Wi-Fi stops working, it can be one of the most frustrating moments in life. Worse still, after finding so many solutions online, you may get rather puzzled about which one to take first. There are a few ways to look into the Wi-Fi issue, but in many cases, it comes down to**driver stability and compatibility** .

## How to solve Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A driver issues

 Here are 3 fixes that have proved useful to many users. You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable & Enable your Qualcomm adapter driver](#fix1)**
2. [**Roll back your Qualcomm adapter driver**](#fix2)
3. [**Update your Qualcomm adapter driver**](#fix3)

## Fix 1: Disable & Enable your Qualcomm adapter driver

 If your PC suddenly loses its network connection, or your wireless adapter fails to detect any available wireless network, you can try this quick fix in the first place.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** into the box and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
2. In the**Device Manager** window, double-click on the**Network adapters** node to expand its drop-down list.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-213.png)
3. Right-click**Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network Adapter** and select**Disable device** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-214.png)
4. Click**Yes** to confirm.
5. Go back to Device Manager and right-click**Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network Adapter** again. This time, select**Enable device** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-215.png)

 Now your Qualcomm wireless network adapter should be available for use again. Open your web browser to see whether the Internet is connected properly. If it isn’t, please read on and try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Rollback your Qualcomm adapter driver

 If you lose your network connection right after installing a new driver for the Qualcomm adapter or running a Windows Update, you should roll back your driver to a previous version.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** into the box and click**OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
2. In the**Device Manager** window, double-click on the**Network adapters** node to expand its drop-down list.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-213.png)
3. Right-click**Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless Network Adapter** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-216.png)
4. Go to the**Driver** tab and click**Roll Back Driver** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/qualcom-atheros.png)
5. Choose a reason based on your own situation, then click**Yes** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-218.png)
6. Reboot your computer for the changes to be fully implemented.

 If the**Roll Back Driver** option appears dimmed, that means there’s no driver to roll back to. In this case, you should head over to**[Fix 3](#fix3)** .

 Open your web browser to check whether the network connection has gone back to normal. If not, you should proceed to Fix 3.

## Fix 3: Update your Qualcomm adapter driver

 If you still can’t get onto the Internet, then chances are your Qualcomm adapter driver is corrupt, outdated, or not compatible with your operating system. To fix the problem, you should try to update your driver.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, but it may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) driver. And if you want Windows to download and install drivers automatically, you still need to have network connectivity, otherwise, it won’t work. You can also search for the most recent correct driver for your wireless adapter online, download it and install it step by step – but it’s rather time-consuming and error-prone. So if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually,**you can do it with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version.

 You can update drivers both online and offline. According to your actual situation, jump ahead to the section you’re interested in:

* **[My network connection is not stable but still works at times](#stable)**
* **[My network connection doesn’t work at all](#not)**

### The network connection is not stable but still works at times

 When your computer is connected to the network, you can use Driver Easy to update device drivers the normal way. Here’s how:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)
