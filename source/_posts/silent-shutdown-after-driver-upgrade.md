Then download and update the display card driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

### 1.3 Run the hardware troubleshooter to see if it’s a hardware problem

 If you’ve already tried the above but your screen remains black, you may need to check if the problem is with your hardware devices: faulty power supply, motherboard, display cable (HDMI, DP, or VGA), and/or the graphics card itself could also cause a black screen problem.

 To see if this is your case, you can run the built-in hardware troubleshooter in this way:

1. Open the Run dialog by pressing**Windows + R** on your keyboard.
2. Type**`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`** into the box and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-troubleshooter-1.jpg)
3. When the troubleshooter window opens, click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-troubleshooter-2.jpg)
4. If any issues are found, follow the on-screen instructions to fix them.

5. If none are found, close the window and try the next fix below.

### 1.4 Restore BIOS settings

 Your monitor will remain black if there are some incorrect settings in BIOS, which stop certain firmware and/or software from starting properly. To see if this is your case, you can try to restore your BIOS settings to default.

 You can reset your BIOS settings back to it’s original to see if that’s the issue for you. Here is how to do it:

1. Press and hold the power button until your computer turns off.
2. Disconnect the AC power cord from the power supply, and then open your computer case.
3. On your motherboard, remove your CMOS battery with your fingernail or a non-conductive screwdriver. The CMOS battery looks like this:

### 2.2 Try different hardware devices

 At this point, if none of the above helps, you may need to consider different hardware devices, as it could be a problem with the graphics card, the hardware device itself, when it blacks out after a driver installation. As mentioned, faulty power supply, display cables, or motherboard could also be the culprit.

 If you’re not sure about this, you can always seek help from a hardware technician to see if they can run some tests on your hardware components to make sure that they’re still working fine.

 Hope one of the above helps to fix the black screen after installing graphics card driver problem for you, or at least point to the right direction for you. If you have other working fixes, please feel free to leave a comment below.
