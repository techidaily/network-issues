## 1\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues, including graphics glitches, can be caused by corrupted or missing game files. Therefore, you’ll need to perform an integrity check to resolve your problem. Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Open your game launcher.
2. Locate your profile. Then click on the drop-down and select**Integrity check** .

 This may take some minutes to redownload and reinstall any missing or corrupted game files.

 When the process is finished, relaunch your game and test the gameplay. If it’s still unplayable when it’s raining, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Delete the game cache

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .
