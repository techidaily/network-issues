## 1\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues, including graphics glitches, can be caused by corrupted or missing game files. Therefore, you’ll need to perform an integrity check to resolve your problem. Follow the steps below to do so.

 This may take some minutes to redownload and reinstall any missing or corrupted game files.

 When the process is finished, relaunch your game and test the gameplay. If it’s still unplayable when it’s raining, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Delete the game cache

 Another great way to troubleshoot your issue is by clearing the cache. Temporary files and data are often stored. But over time, this cached data might become corrupted, which can lead to issues with connectivity, game freezes, slow or unsuccessful game loads, and other performance issues.

1. Open up your EFT launcher.
2. look in the top right where your profile picture is. Click on the drop-down next to it and select**Clear cache** .

## 3\. Clean your temp folder

 Apart from clearing the game cache, you may want to clean the temp folder which stores temporary game files. This won’t cause any issues and instead, you’ll receive a performance boost.

1. Open up your launcher.
2. Locate your profile on the top right. Then click on the drop-down and select**Settings** .

 When it’s done, relaunch your game. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver
