## [WINDOWS] Overcoming Slow Connectivity Issues

 If you ever run into the**Windows 11 or 10 slow Internet** problem, don’t worry. It’s often quite easy to fix…

## 6 fixes for Windows 11/10 Slow Internet

 All the fixes below work in Windows 11/10; just work your way down the list until the Internet slowdown problem is resolved.

1. **[Disable Peer-to-Peer Update](#F1)**
2. **[Adjust the Internet Bandwidth Settings](#F2)**
3. **[Update your WiFi drivers](#F3)**
4. **[Repair system files](#RE)**
5. **[Disable Windows Auto-Tuning](#F4)**
6. **[Disable Large Send Offload](#F5)**
7. **[Some other modifications to try](#network) [](#F5)**

## Fix 1: Disable Peer to Peer Update

**Peer to Peer Update** is a feature in Windows that allows your computer to share Windows updates peer-to-peer with other computers over the Internet, which can compromise our Internet connection, hence the sluggish Internet issue.

 To disable**Peer to Peer Update** :

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type**control update** in the box and press**Enter** .

2. Click**Advanced options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/windowsupdateadvancedoptions.jpg)
3. Click**Delivery Optimization** (or**Choose how updates are delivered** depending on the build of your Windows 10).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/windowsupdatedeliveryoption.jpg)
4. Turn the**Allow downloads from other PCs** (Or**Update from more than one place**) toggle**Off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/windowsupdateallowapps.jpg)
5. Check if the**Windows 11/10 slow Internet** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 2** , below.

---

## Fix 2: Adjust the Internet Bandwidth Settings

 Please note that Group Policy Editor is not supported on Windows 10/11 Home Edition. So if you’re not using Windows Pro, or Enterprise, please move on to [Fix3](#F3) .

 By default, Windows reserves 20% of your bandwidth for Windows Update, system apps, and other purposes, leaving you with 80% bandwidth of Internet connection. If you don’t use Windows Update on a daily basis and the reservation limit slows your Internet down, then you can remove the limit by setting the value to 0.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift,** and**Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager.
2. Click**Run new task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/taskmanagernewtask.jpg)
3. Copy & paste **gpedit.msc** into the box, tick the box before **Create this task with administrative privileges** , and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b67c73fda271.png)
4. Under **Computer Configuration** , double-click on**Administrative Templates** \>**Network** \>**QoS Packet Scheduler** . Then double-click on **Limit reservable bandwidth** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7121e2c956c.jpg)
5. Click the**Enabled** option and set**Bandwidth limit (%)** value to**0** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b712108609d3.jpg)
6. Is your Internet getting any faster? If it’s still grinding to a crawl, you should try**Fix 3** , below.

1. **[Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect](#fortect)**
2. [**Run SFC scan**](#SFC)

### Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect

 The slow internet in your Windows 10 computer could be caused by corrupt system files. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a tool that auto-detects slow internet and specializes in Windows repair.

 With [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , the preliminary will scan your computer’s operating system for viruses, malware, and missing, damaged, or corrupt files, then it removes all problematic files found and replaces them with new healthy files.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click on **Command Prompt** and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28ad73ad4a9.png)
2. Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.
3. In the command prompt window, type**sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28aee247664.jpg)  
 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check your computer to see if the**Windows 10 slow internet** problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats! If the issue still persists, please move on to**Fix 5** , below.

---

## Fix 5: Disable Windows Auto-Tuning

**Window Auto-Tuning** is a feature in our Windows 10 to allow for more efficient data transfers. But it can also interfere with the network and cause loss of connectivity. So to disable the feature:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **cmd** . Then right click on **Command Prompt**   and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28ad73ad4a9.png)  

 Click **Yes** when prompted to confirm.
2. Copy & paste **netsh interface tcp show global** into the window and press**Enter** . Then check if**Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level**  is set to**normal** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b70ff100133c.jpg)
3. If yes, you’ll have to copy & paste**netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled** into the window and press**Enter** to disable it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7134aa2923c.jpg)
4. Check to see if your**Windows 10 slow Internet** problem has been solved. If the issue still lingers on, don’t worry, here’s one more fix to try.

---

## Fix 6: Disable Large Send Offload

**Large Send Offload** (**LSO**) is another feature in Windows designated for better network performance. Well-intended, but then the whole thing of allowing background apps to consume large amounts of network bandwidth is the reason why our Internet speed takes a hit. To disable**LSO** :

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc** into the box and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7105728b9d7.png)
2. Double-click on**Network adapters** \>**your network adapter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7106291012e.jpg)
3. Click the**Advanced** tab, then click **Large Send Offload V2 (IPv4)** and set the**value** to**Disabled** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b71075272c84.jpg)
4. Click **Large Send Offload V2 (IPv6)**  and set the**value** to**Disabled** . Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7107f56920e.jpg)
5. Hopefully, your **Windows 10/11 Slow Internet** issue has been resolved successfully.

## Some other modifications

 If none of the above network-related changes prove effective, here are some other tweaks that you can do to improve your network connectivity situation, and thus help to improve the network speed on your computer. Check the following to see if you’ve done them all:

* **Reduce the number of devices connected to the same router** to make sure that your main computer gets the most speed.
* **Use a wired network connection** (with an Ethernet cable) instead of Wi-Fi. If this is not an option, move your computer closer to the router.
* **Update your router firmware** if you haven’t already.
* In your router settings, try to **enable QoS to prioritize gaming traffic** . If you’re not sure where to find it, please visit your router’s official website to find the manual or seek help from your ISP.
* **Contact your ISP** . If you’ve tried everything and your internet is still slow, it might be an issue with your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Contact them for support.
* **Upgrade Your Plan** : If your internet plan is outdated or doesn’t provide enough bandwidth for your needs, consider upgrading to a plan with higher speeds.
* **Upgrade your hardware** . If the network settings are set up all correctly, but the network speed is still slow, it’s possible that your hardware is throttling the network speed. In that case, you may need to consider a more advanced router or modem, network cables and network adapters.
