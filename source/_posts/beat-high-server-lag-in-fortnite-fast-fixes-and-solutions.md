## Fix 1: Restart Fortnite

 This is the quickest and easiest fix to try when you run into Fortnite high ping issue. Just**exit Fortnite and restart your game** . 

 Now run the game again and test to see if its ping is still high. If so, move on to Fix 2, below.

## Fix 2: Reboot your network

 One of the easiest fixes for high ping issues is to simply**restart your network** . By rebooting your network, your Internet connection speed may be back to normal. So maybe it will also resolve the high ping issue. Here is how to do it: 

**Unplug** your modem (and your wireless router, if it’s a separate device) from power for **60 seconds** .

##  Fix 3: Close bandwidth-hogging applications

## Fix 4: Update your network driver

 An outdated or missing network driver may also trigger the high ping issue. **Try updating your network driver**   and maybe this issue can be fixed.

 There are two ways to update your network driver: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Update your network driver manually**  – You can update your network driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your network adapter. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact network adapter model and your version of Windows. 

**Or**

Join a squad to see if you’ve resolved the high ping issue.

If not, you may need to check if it is a server issue.

##  Fix 7: Check if it’s a server issue

 If none of the fixes helps,**it could simply be a server issue** . You can go to **[Fortnite forums](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/)**  and see if anyone else is having high ping issues. You can also visit https://fortniteserverstatus.com/ to check the Fortnite server status.

## Fix 8: Use a VPN

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above but nothing seems to work, consider using a **VPN** .

**Note:** Do not use those so-called free VPNs, as they are not safe, and they are always crowded during busy times.

 A paid and reliable VPN usually delivers a better and more stable performance during peak hours, so it guarantees your smooth gaming experience.

Here are some VPN providers we recommend:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [ExpressVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
