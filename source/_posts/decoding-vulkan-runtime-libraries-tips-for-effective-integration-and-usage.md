 Conclusion first:**Vulkan Run Time Libraries is no virus** and you’re well off just leave it where it is. 

 Vulkan RunTime Libraries,also known as Vulkan Run time Libraries or VulkanRT, is installed by display card manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel or AMD the last time you updated your video driver. It’s not a malware or virus, instead, it’s a3D graphics and compute API by Khronos Group. 

 It aims to provide lower overhead, more direct control over the GPU and lower CPU usage. You can compare it with Direct3D and Mantle if it helps with the understanding. Some mentioned that it might be required eventually in new games (such as Steam) or graphical applications. 

 Now you know more about the Vulkan Run Time Libraries listed in your**Programs and Features** window, you should know that there’s nothing for you to worry about. Feel free to use your updated graphic card as usual.

## **What to do with Vulkan Run Time Libraries?** 

 As mentioned, you don’t need to do anything about **Vulkan Run Time Libraries** . It’s not a malware nor a virus, rather, it’s the new graphics PAR render with a simpler, thinner driver, and efficient CPU multi-threading capabilities. 

 You should know that not all games use Vulkan, and if you’re sure that no games in your PC use Vulkan, you may uninstall it as you like. 

 But note that Vulkan Run Time Libraries cannot be manually installed after you remove it from your operating system. You need to install the most recent version of the graphics adapter driver which ships with Vulkan to get it back.
