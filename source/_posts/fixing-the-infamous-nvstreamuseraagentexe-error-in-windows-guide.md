##  1\. Reinstall NVIDIA Display Driver

4) Restart your computer after the uninstall. 

 5) Windows will help you find a correct driver for your system. If this problem remains, you need to update the driver. See more details in Method 2\. 

##  2\. Update NVIDIA Display Driver 

 Your application error is probably being caused by driver issues. The steps above may resolve it, but if they don’t, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
