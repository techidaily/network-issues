## Try these fixes

 You might not have to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Close unnecessary programs](#fix1)**
2. **[Delete temporary files](#fix2)**
3. **[Update your network driver](#fix3)**
4. **[Use a wired connection](#fix4)**
5. **[Change your DNS settings](#fix5)**
6. **[Reduce the graphics quality](#fix6)**

## Fix 1: Close unnecessary programs

 The game lagging is generally a sign of a slow game. This can be caused by having too many high-power programs using your system resources. For the most optimal experience, it is recommended that when you run Roblox, you close those other programs. To do this, take these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and**X** at the same time to select**Task Manager** .

2. Select each resource-hogging application and click**End Task** to close them one by one.

 Try to launch Roblox again to see if it stops lagging now. If the problem remains, please move on.

---

## Fix 2: Delete temporary files

 Temporary files created by Windows or programs you use could take up some hard drive space, which slows down your computer. So to make your computer and the programs run smoother, you should delete those temp files. Here’s how you can do this:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **%temp%** and then press **Enter** on your keyboard.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files.jpg)
3. Delete all the files in the **temp**  folder. (Press **Ctrl**  and **A** at the same time to select all the files. Then right-click and select **Delete** .)

4. If a window pops up saying that **The action can’t be completed** , simply check the box **Do this for all current items** and click **Skip** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PC-delete-temp-files.jpg)
5. Now go to your **Recycling Bin**  from your desktop. Right-click on it and select **Empty Recycle Bin** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empty-recycle-bin.jpg)
6. Click **Yes** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/empty-recycle-bin-click-yes.jpg)

 After deleting the temp files, launch Roblox to check if the lag is reduced. If the problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update your network driver

 When your Roblox is lagging, it’s generally a sign of a slow connection. Your outdated network driver can be the culprit and make your game super laggy. To fix it, you need to update your network driver, especially if you can’t remember when you last updated it.

### How to update the network driver

 You can manually update your network driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it**automatically** with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a useful tool that will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. With Driver Easy, updating drivers is just a matter of a few clicks.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DE-scan-now-6.0.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

## Fix 4: Use a wired connection

 For gaming purposes, a wired connection is preferable over a wireless connection. Wireless connections are most susceptible to interference and aren’t as consistent as wired connections. More importantly, they increase latency. Therefore, if possible, use a wired connection when you play a game online.

 However, if you don’t have access to the wired connection, don’t worry, you can check out other fixes below.

---

## Fix 5: Change your DNS settings

 Sometimes your ISP-supplied DNS server might be slow or not properly configured for caching, which can slow your connection a little bit. And that might be the reason that your Roblox is so laggy. To save you time troubleshooting, you’re supposed to change your DNS settings. Here we recommend the DNS addresses from Google:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**network icon** , then click**Open Network & Internet settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-network-settings.png)
2. Click**Change adapter options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/change-adapter-options.png)
3. Right-click**the network you’re using** , then click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/click-ethernet.png)
4. Select**Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** , then click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ipv4.png)
5. Select**Use the following DNS server addresses** , fill in the Google DNS server addresses as below, then click**OK** .  

 **Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8**  
 **Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/change-to-google-dns.png)
6. Launch Roblox again to see if it still lags. If so, please move on.

---

## Fix 6: Reduce the graphics quality

 Intense in-game graphics settings could also make Roblox lag, especially if your graphics card and processor are not very advanced. In this case, to reduce the lagging problem, you can reduce the graphics quality as follows:

1. Launch any [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/home) game.
2. Select a Roblox game and click on the**Play** button.  

 If you haven’t installed the Roblox Player, a window will be popping up on the screen. Just click**Download and Install Roblox** and then double-click on the installation file to install it.
3. Press**ESC** on your keyboard and on the upper left corner of the screen, you’ll see the**three-line** tab. Just click it.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/three-line-tab-3.png)
4. Click the**settings** tab. In the**Graphics Mode** section, click the**next >** arrow to change it to**Manual** . Doing so will enable you to adjust the graphics quality by yourself.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adjust-graphics-settings-1.png)
5. In the**Graphics Quality** section, click the button with the minus sign**(-)** to lower the graphics quality.  

 After that, click**Resume Game** to return to your game.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adjust-graphics-settings-2.png)

---

## Fix 7: Delete the textures folder

 To speed up Roblox on your computer, you should delete the textures folder. Without textures, the game should run a little bit smoother.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-48.png)

To do so:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and type**Roblox player** , then**Open file location** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-43.png)
2. Right-click the execution file for**Roblox Player** and select**Open file location** again.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-44.png)
3. Click**PlatformContent** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-45.png)
4. Click the**PC** folder.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-46.png)
5. Click the**textures** folder.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-47.png)
6. Delete all the other folders except for these:**grass, sky, water** , and the**dds** files.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-48.png)

 After taking all the steps, play a Roblox game. You’re supposed to be able to have your game performance improved.

## Fix 8: Repair system files

 Over time, important system files can become corrupted or go missing, which can lead to performance problems. Using the System File Checker tool in Windows can scan for any missing or corrupted files and automatically restore them. To do this, To do this, open Command Prompt as an administrator, type**sfc /scannow,** and hit Enter. Let this scan run, and it will check your system files against a cached copy and replace any that are damaged.

 Or you can use a dedicated Windows repair tool, **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , to help you automate this process. Its FREE scan includes a search for privacy vulnerabilities, damaged or missing OS files, any traces or malware or unwanted applications, and overall stability issues.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Launch Fortect and run a complete scan.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fortect-START-SCAN.png)
3. You’ll get a scan summary listing all the issues it detects. Click **START REPAIR** to fix the problems (and you’ll need to pay for the full version which comes with a **60-day money-back** guarantee).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fortect-Start-Repair-1.png)

Once done, restart your machine and check if it fixes your issue.
