 If you find your computer**screen is blurry** , don’t worry. You can fix the**blurry screen issues**  quickly and easily.

## Why is my monitor blurry?

 The blurry screen issues present with different symptoms, so you may get**blurry text** on your display, or**apps are blurry** , especially on the external monitor. Sometimes you may see**blurry fonts** on your computer, and that’s one of the problems for the blurry screens.

 But don’t worry. We will help you fix your problem and get a clear screen.

## Try these fixes

 Before you try, ensure to keep your monitor screen**clean and dry** . If you’re using multiple displays, remember to adjust all the monitor screen resolutions to the same.
