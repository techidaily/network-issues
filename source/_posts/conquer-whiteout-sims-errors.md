| **Operating System** | Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1), Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | 1.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, AMD Athlon 64 Dual-Core 4000+ or equivalent             |
| **Memory**           | At least 2 GB RAM                                                                 |
| **Graphics**         | Intel HD 4600 (AMD or NVIDIA equivalent)                                          |
| **RAM**              | 2 GB available space                                                              |
