### Fix 6: Does your PC meet the requirements?

 If all else fails, then you might have to check if the specs of your PC to see if it meets the requirements of the game.

 The following is a table of minimum system requirements to run The Sims 4:

| **Operating System** | Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1), Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | 1.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, AMD Athlon 64 Dual-Core 4000+ or equivalent             |
| **Memory**           | At least 2 GB RAM                                                                 |
| **Graphics**         | Intel HD 4600 (AMD or NVIDIA equivalent)                                          |
| **RAM**              | 2 GB available space                                                              |

Here is how to check if your computer spec has met the requirements:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** to bring up DirectX Diagnostic Tool.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-960.png)

 3) Click the **Display** **1**  tab, and then check your graphics card’s information. (If you are using two graphics card, you should check on the **Display 2** tab for the information about your graphics card too)

 If one of the specs fails to meet the requirement, you might want to consider upgrading your PC. If your PC meets all of them, then the white screen error on The Sims 4 may not be related with your computer hardware at all.
