 This low resolution issue may occur if you have the wrong or outdated display driver on your computer. So you should update your display driver to see if it fixes the problem.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
