## Method 2: Contact the manufacturer of your graphics adapter

 The error may also result from the faulty graphics adapter you are using. You can try contacting the manufacturer of your computer or graphics adapter for more help. If your device is still under warranty, you can also ask the manufacturer to have it repaired or replaced.
