![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59daf736e8e19.jpg)

 If you’re having problems upgrading your computer to Windows 10, and you see the error message saying that “ **The display manufacturer hasn’t made your display compatible with Windows 10\. Check with the manufacture for support** .” you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

Here are 3 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Re-install LogMeIn Mirror Adapter](#m1) Method 2:[Clean Re-install Display Driver](#m2) Method 3:[Update Display Driver](#m3)**
