## Fix 5: Reset Winsock

 Winsock is an application in Windows that handles the data on the computer that programs use for Internet access. So when you can’t connect WoW to its server, you can give Winsock a try. It reverts the Winsock Catalog back to its default settings, which often proves useful in network problems.

Here is how to reset Winsock data:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-566.png)

 2) When prompted for permission, click **Yes**  to run Command Prompt.

 3) In the Command Prompt, type **netsh winsock reset**  and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap7-5.jpg)

4) Restart your computer.

5) Launch WoW to see if it can be connected to the game server.

 WoW still can’t be connected to the server? Don’t worry – there are a few more fixes for you to try.

---

## Fix 6: Restart your network

 The WoW won’t connect to server issue may be a glitch caused by your router. So you can restart your modem to see if it fixes the issue.

Here is how to restart your network:

 1) Unplug your modem (and your wireless router, if it’s a separate device) from the power socket.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap2-8.jpg)

_modem_

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap3-5.jpg)

 3) Plug the network devices back in again and wait until the indicator lights are back to the normal state.

 3) Open WoW to see if it connects to the servers properly. If yes, then you’ve solved the issue. If it still doesn’t help, please try **Fix 7** , below.

 DNS and IP issues may also cause WoW to disconnect from the server. So you can flush your DNS and renew your IP to see if it solves the issue.

### To flush your DNS

## Fix 8: Is World of Warcraft down?

 If you’ve exhausted all the solutions above but the problem is still not resolved, then it’s probably a server outage with the game. You can check [**WOW’s official twitter**](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS) to see if it is down and stay tuned until the game is fully restored.

## Fix 9: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended.[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC. Wait a few minutes, and it will give you a detailed report of your PC status.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fortectstartrepair.png)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with a full money-back guarantee and full technical support. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact their support team.

Once finished with the repair, check if the error has been resolved.
